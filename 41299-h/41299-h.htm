<small>PAPA’S BIRTHDAY</small></h2>

<p>It was the month of May in the year 1853&mdash;you see
that our subject is not lost in the night of time&mdash;it was
a Monday and there was a flower market on Boulevard
Saint-Martin, in front, or rather on both sides of the
Château d’Eau. The booths of the dealers extended as
far as Rue de Lancry, a favor which had been only recently
accorded to the flower girls, but upon which the
passers-by had as much reason to congratulate themselves
as the dealers and the people of that portion of
the quarter. Is there anything more delightful to the
eye than flowers? What is there which charms the sight
and pleases the sense of smell more?</p>

<p>Are there people who do not love flowers? If you
should tell me that there were, I would not believe it.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, which was a rare occurrence
during that spring, as you must remember as well as I.
The sun had deigned to show himself, and people were
very grateful to him, because the sun for the last few<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>
years had become too high and mighty a prince in
France; he no longer condescended to mingle with the
people, he showed himself too rarely to the inhabitants
of this part of the globe. And yet, although we do not
adore him on our knees, like the Incas, we take no less
pleasure in seeing him, in feeling the pleasant warmth
of his beams, and although we are great friends of invention
and of progress, we have not yet found anything
to replace the sun.</p>

<p>There were therefore many people on the boulevards,
and particularly near the flower market; everyone was
anxious to take advantage of a fine day, not being certain
of another on the morrow; and everybody was sensible:
fine weather, pleasure and happiness we must seize you
when you come to us, and never say: “I will wait till
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Among all the people who were walking and sauntering
and examining the flowers displayed on the asphalt
or the concrete, there were, as is always the case at that
market, more women than men. Do the ladies care more
for flowers than we do? I might say some very pretty
things on that subject, as for example: “Birds of a
feather flock together,” or: “Where can one be more
at home than in the bosom of his family?” or again&mdash;but
no, I will not repeat what you have already seen or
heard a hundred times. Moreover, I think that François
I said something better than any of that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the ladies are fonder of flowers than
we are, you see they have much more time to attend to<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>
them. I once knew a bachelor, a clerk in a business
house, who adored flowers, and although of small means,
could not resist the temptation to purchase a handsome
rosebush or a wood-violet, which he instantly carried
home and placed in triumph on his window-sill. But that
gentleman was a heavy sleeper, and when he woke he
had hardly time to dress and go to his office. He did
not dine at home, and when he returned at night he was
always in a hurry to go to bed. The result was that,
after two or three days, when he attempted to gloat over
the flower that he had purchased, he was surprised to
find it dead.</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you water it?” someone would ask
him.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;because I have noticed that it always
rains sooner or later.”</p>

<p>We will, with your permission, allow those of the
passers-by who are indifferent to us to go their way, and
will follow the steps of a family composed of a mother,
her son and her daughter.</p>

<p>The mother’s name was Madame Glumeau; her first
name was Lolotte. She was a lady who had reached the
wrong side of forty; she had once been pretty, a piquant
brunette, whose bright and mischievous eyes made many
victims. But time had passed that way! What a deplorable
passage, that of time,&mdash;a passage which should
be well barricaded!</p>

<p>It was not that Madame Glumeau’s features had
changed very much. No, her eyes were still very bright,<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
her nose rather delicate; her hair, which was yet black,
still fell in thick curls on each side of her face; but she
had grown enormously stout, so that her whole figure
was changed and her waist enlarged.</p>

<p>Even the face had undergone the influence of that exuberant
health; the cheeks had become rotund, the chin
had trebled, the neck had shortened, and the complexion
had become purple; and there were people who were
cruel enough to say to her:</p>

<p>“What perfect health you enjoy! No one needs to
ask you how you are!”</p>

<p>At that compliment, Madame Glumeau would try to
smile, as she replied:</p>

<p>“That is true, I am not often ill!”</p>

<p>But in the depths of her heart she bitterly lamented
having become like a ball, and would willingly have submitted
to a severe illness, in order to recover her figure
of earlier days. However, as one is always inclined to
flatter oneself a little, Madame Glumeau was very far
from considering herself a <i>tower</i>, as her dear lady friends
called her; and when she looked at herself in the mirror,
she still bestowed upon herself a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>Let us come to the two children; we are not speaking
of little brats, who have to be led along by the hand,
but of a boy of nineteen and a young lady of sixteen.</p>

<p>The young man was very ill-favored; he had no one
of his mother’s features, and squinted in too pronounced
a fashion, a fact which necessarily imparted more or less
vagueness to his countenance; but one might judge from<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
the expression of his face that Monsieur Astianax&mdash;that
was young Glumeau’s name&mdash;was not displeased with
his little person, and still less with his wit. Unluckily,
nature had not bestowed upon him a figure corresponding
to the advantages with which he considered himself
to be endowed; despite the high heels that he wore and
the double soles that he put in his shoes, Monsieur
Astianax Glumeau had been unable to make himself taller
than his mother, who was four feet nine.</p>

<p>If young Glumeau was short, his sister, by way of compensation,
at sixteen, was as tall as a bean-pole, and
threatened to attain the stature of a drum-major. As
thin as her mother was stout, Eolinde Glumeau had at
all events a face which did her honor; although she was
not so pretty as her mother had once been, she had regular
features, rather large eyes, a small mouth, fine teeth,
and all the freshness of a peach still on the tree. But&mdash;for
there were always buts in that family&mdash;Mademoiselle
Eolinde was afflicted with a very noticeable defect of
speech; she stuttered in a way that was very tiresome
to those who listened to her. Her parents declared that
that would cure itself, and as a corrective to that infirmity
they insisted that their daughter should talk as
much as possible. Mademoiselle Eolinde obeyed her
parents to an extent that was sometimes very terrible for
her friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>The Glumeau family had been on Boulevard du Château
d’Eau a long while, going from one dealer to another,
stopping in front of the flowers, sticking their<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>
noses into the finest ones, asking the price, hesitating,
and not deciding.</p>

<p>At last Madame Glumeau turned about once more and
halted in front of a very handsome pomegranate tree,
saying:</p>

<p>“I think I will buy this pomegranate for your father.
A pomegranate will please Honoré; he will like it very
much.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, what connection is there between this
shrub and my father?” queried young Glumeau, looking
toward Boulevard du Temple and Porte Saint-Martin at
the same moment.</p>

<p>“What’s that! what connection? What do you mean
by that, Astianax? Isn’t to-morrow your father’s fête-day,
as his name is Honoré? We are going to give him
flowers as usual. I select this pomegranate, which is
very handsome; I don’t see what there is in that to surprise
you.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that, mamma; I said: ‘what connection is
there between a pomegranate&mdash;<i>grenadier</i>&mdash;and my father,
who has never been a soldier?’ Oh! if he had been a
soldier, I could understand your choice of this shrub and
the allusion, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, my dear boy, you are terribly tiresome with
your allusions; you want to put allusions in everything;
just wait until you are a man.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, dear mamma, but flowers have a language;
so in your place I should have thought that a
myrtle, the emblem of love&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, I have been giving your father myrtles
for twenty years and he must have had enough of them.
Everything in life goes by, and we have used the myrtle
long enough; it seems to me that I can properly vary it
a little. After twenty years one is not forbidden to
change bouquets. I have decided, I am going to buy this
pomegranate.&mdash;Don’t you think, Eolinde, that this will
please your father?”</p>

<p>“Oh! ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, it will pl&mdash;please him very mu&mdash;u&mdash;uch.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to buy for him? You must
make up your mind, children, for we intend to go to the
play after dinner, and it is getting late.”</p>

<p>“B&mdash;b&mdash;bless me!” replied the tall young lady, “I
would li&mdash;i&mdash;ike that fl&mdash;fl&mdash;flower&mdash;you know&mdash;you
know&mdash;it’s the&mdash;I d&mdash;d&mdash;don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“But what flower? tell us its name.”</p>

<p>“I d&mdash;d&mdash;don’t reme&mdash;e&mdash;ember.”</p>

<p>“In that case, ask the woman if she has any,” said
Monsieur Astianax, smiling maliciously, for he very often
made fun of the difficulty which his sister had in speaking.</p>

<p>“What a stu&mdash;u&mdash;u&mdash;pid you are, Astianax!” cried
the girl, shrugging her shoulders and looking down at
her brother as if she were searching for a little dog.
“Let me alo&mdash;o&mdash;one; it’s a flow&mdash;ower with b&mdash;b&mdash;bells.”</p>

<p>“Bells?”</p>

<p>“No, little bell-flowers&mdash;brown.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you mean, daughter; it is a&mdash;I
don’t know the name; but come, I saw some over yonder.”</p>

<p>And the stout lady, having paid for the pomegranate
and hired a porter to carry it, led her daughter to the
booth of a dealer who had a large assortment of tulips.
Mademoiselle Eolinde examined them for some time, then
murmured:</p>

<p>“This isn’t what I wanted. No matter, let me see. Oh!
they don’t smell&mdash;they don’t smell of anything; I’d rather
get something else.”</p>

<p>“Well, what? Come, choose.”</p>

<p>“Oh! see that fl&mdash;flower over there; a m&mdash;m&mdash;mag&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The name makes no difference, let us go and buy it.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Eolinde stopped in front of a magnificent
magnolia, which had already flowered in the heat of a
greenhouse; she placed her nose upon the lovely white
egg-shaped blossom, which, as it opened, exhaled a delicious
odor of orange and lemon; then she raised her
head and said: “That smells too strong.”</p>

<p>“Look here, mamzelle!” cried the flower woman, irritated
to see the tall girl take her mother away in another
direction, “you mustn’t stick your face on our flowers
like that! Did anyone ever see such a bean-pole as that
creature who buries her muzzle in the blossom of my
magnolia, and then walks off, as if she had been sniffing
at my poodle’s tail! Go on, you long-legged cockroach!
Go somewhere else and buy Indian pinks, they’ll suit you
better!<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>”</p>

<p>The Glumeau family did not hear, or rather pretended
not to hear the somewhat forcible complaints of the
woman with the magnolia; they had stopped in front of
a booth where there was a large quantity of laurel. Mademoiselle
Eolinde, whom the lesson which she had just
received had not corrected, smelled several laurel bushes
and cried:</p>

<p>“Ah! that sm&mdash;smells nasty!”</p>

<p>This time Madame Glumeau hastily dragged her
daughter away, saying in her ear:</p>

<p>“Why, Eolinde, do you want to get into a row and
have scenes with all these flower women? You shouldn’t
say such things as that, my girl, especially when you
don’t buy; and if you won’t decide upon what you want,
we will go away and you won’t have a flower to give
your father, who is so fond of them. That will be very
nice on his birthday!”</p>

<p>“If you will take my advice, sister,” said Monsieur
Astianax, “you’ll give our father a pot of immortelles,
because you see the immortelle means that he will live
a long time, and the allusion is easily understood.”</p>

<p>“A pot of immortelles!” cried the mother; “they are
lovely flowers, upon my word! You are mad, Astianax!
You might as well give your father a pot of sweet-basil
such as the cobblers have in their stalls.&mdash;Look, Eolinde,
there is a superb rosebush! come, let us buy that,&mdash;that
will be your bouquet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but a ro&mdash;o&mdash;osebush; I wanted s&mdash;s&mdash;something
else.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>”</p>

<p>“That is to say, you don’t know what you do want;
and this unfortunate messenger who is following us with
that huge pomegranate in his arms, looks as if he were
swimming in perspiration.”</p>

<p>“Why, it isn’t so ve&mdash;ve&mdash;very hot, mamma!”</p>

<p>Madame Glumeau, paying no heed to the lamentations
of her daughter, who did not want the rosebush, but did
not know what she did want, ordered her messenger to
take the flower, then turned to her son and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Astianax, you are the only one who has not
chosen a flower, but I believe you told me that you preferred
to give your father a bouquet to carry in the hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear mamma, because in a bouquet for the hand,
you choose different flowers, which have even more
meaning when placed side by side. The Turks call
that a <i>selam;</i> I mean to give my father a <i>selam.</i>”</p>

<p>“But in what connection? Your father never has
claimed to be a Turk, so far as I know! He won’t have
any idea what your bouquet means.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, dear mamma, I will explain the
allusion to him.”</p>

<p>“All right, but make haste; it seems to me that you
might very well have selected your oriental bouquet
while we were choosing our plants!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking, but haven’t found what I want!”</p>

<p>“But there certainly is no lack of flower girls here.
Ah! there is one who is very pretty indeed; if her
bouquets resemble her, I think that you will find what
you want.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br /><br />
VIOLETTE</h2>

<p>Madame Glumeau had said nothing beyond the truth,
when she observed that the flower girl to whom she
pointed was very pretty, for she was speaking of Violette.</p>

<p>Let us then make Violette’s acquaintance; it is always
pleasant to know a pretty girl, even though she sells
bouquets, but especially when she sells nothing else.</p>

<p>Violette was from eighteen to nineteen years of age;
her figure was slender and shapely; she was tall enough
but not too tall, which, in women, is rather a defect than
an advantage; but there was grace in all her movements,
and refinement in her simplicity.</p>

<p>Her face was oval; her fine brown hair left bare a
forehead which was instinct with innocence and pride.
Her eyes too were brown, but their expression was immeasurably
sweet and they were fringed by long lashes
which imparted to them an infinite charm; the eyebrows
were but slightly marked. Her mouth was not very
small, but it was intelligent; small mouths, which are unintelligent,
of which there are so many, are not nearly
so desirable. Lastly, her teeth were white and very regular.
As you see, all these things must have combined
to make a very pretty girl. Still there are many who<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
possess all Violette’s advantages, but whom we pass
without being charmed by them; the reason is, that it is
not always sufficient to be beautiful in order to attract;
a woman must also have in herself that indefinable something
which fascinates, which surprises, which allures,
which gives expression to the face and charm to the
voice. That something is a gift of nature, which coquetry
tries in vain to supply, and the flower girl had
that gift. Moreover, there was in her speech and in her
manners something which distinguished her from her
companions. She expressed herself in better language
and she was always courteous, even when one did not
buy of her. So that Violette was noticed first for her
beauty and then for her courtesy. Courtesy is a thing
so rare among street peddlers, and even elsewhere!
There are so many people who think that they acquire
the air of being somebody by affecting an insolent tone
and a contemptuous glance! Poor fools! If they did
not arouse laughter, they would arouse compassion.</p>

<p>But was this flower girl, who expressed herself in
better language than others of her trade, the child of
rich people stricken by misfortune? Was it to support
destitute and infirm parents that that pretty girl had decided
to take up a business for which she was not born?</p>

<p>Not at all. Violette did not know her parents, she
did not know whether they still lived, but what she did
know perfectly was that they had abandoned her.</p>

<p>Put out to nurse in a small village of Picardie, near
Abbeville, she evidently possessed little interest for them,<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>
for they had forgotten to pay the woman who had undertaken
to replace her mother. The nurse was patient for
a long while, but after three years, hearing nothing from
her nursling’s parents, and being too poor to add a little
stranger to her numerous family, the woman was about
to leave the child at the Foundling Hospital, when an old
lady who was passing through the village, touched with
compassion for the deserted little one, offered the nurse
to take charge of her and to take her to Paris with her.</p>

<p>The nurse assented, and took the lady’s address, in
order that she might write to her if the child’s parents
should ever claim her.</p>

<p>But who were her parents?</p>

<p>To the lady’s question the peasant woman replied:</p>

<p>“Faith, I hardly know, or rather I don’t know, at all.
As to the mother, I am very sure I never saw her. I
was at the nurses’ bureau on Rue Sainte-Apolline; a
fine gentleman&mdash;I guess he was a servant&mdash;came into
the place, while I was taking the air in the yard; I was
the first one he saw, and he asked me if I wanted to take
a brat that was born the night before. I says yes; then
he says: ‘I don’t need to look any further; you’ll do as
well as another; take your bundle and come.’&mdash;I went
with him; there was a carriage at the door, and I got
in with the swell servant. We drove to a street I don’t
know the name of, he took me into a house, with a concierge,
and up to the second floor, into a handsome room.
I found a gentleman there, very well dressed, a pretty
man with a fine figure; he had a splendid gold chain<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>
sticking out of his fob. He was a young man, about
thirty-two or thirty-three, more or less. And when he
saw the man come in who had brought me there, he
says:</p>

<p>“‘Come, make haste, Comtois! I don’t know what to
do with the child! It has been crying until it has burst
the drum of my ear, but I can’t nurse it. Have you
brought a nurse at last?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, monsieur, here’s one who will take charge of
the little girl.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah! that is very lucky!’</p>

<p>“And with that the gentleman, without even looking
at me to see how I was built and whether I had much
milk, motioned to me to go with him into another room,
where I saw a little girl, just come into the world,
wriggling on a sofa with cushions; they didn’t even have
a cradle for her. The gentleman says to me:</p>

<p>“‘Take this child and carry it away at once, for it
cries enough to split one’s head.’</p>

<p>“To that I answers:</p>

<p>“‘It will be twenty francs a month, without counting
sugar and soap!’</p>

<p>“‘All right, that’s understood,’ he says; and he puts
a hundred francs in my hand, saying: ‘This is for the
first expenses; don’t you be afraid, I’ll send you money,
you shall have plenty of it.’</p>

<p>“At that I makes another reverence and says:</p>

<p>“‘I am a Picarde, monsieur, from the village of
Coulange, near Abbeville; my name is Marguerite<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>
Thomasseau; my husband raises donkeys, and we’ve
had four nurslings already.’</p>

<p>“‘All right, take this little one and go.’</p>

<p>“‘But, monsieur,’ I says, ‘what about the <i>layette;</i>
where’s the little one’s <i>layette?</i>’</p>

<p>“At that, the handsome gentleman looks at his swell
servant as if he was surprised, and says:</p>

<p>“‘What’s this woman talking about? What’s a <i>layette?</i>’</p>

<p>“The servant who was better instructed than his
master, says:</p>

<p>“‘Monsieur, it is the child’s trousseau, the little things
that people give to dress it in.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! the devil! I didn’t know that myself, and it
seems she didn’t think of it either! Never mind, Comtois,
give her some of my trousers and waistcoats, give her
my old dressing-gown and some linen; the nurse can
make them over and we’ll send her something else later.
Make haste, Comtois. Here, put in this handkerchief too,
which belongs to the child’s mother, and which I put in
my pocket by mistake yesterday.’</p>

<p>“The servant made me up a bundle in a hurry; and a
queer <i>layette</i> it was, I tell you! I don’t believe that any
young one ever had one like it; it consisted of a woolen
dressing-gown lined with silk, three pairs of broadcloth
trousers, six cravats, two white piqué waistcoats and one
black satin one, six fine shirts, a pair of suspenders, and
a white handkerchief embroidered with a cipher, with a
coronet on it. As for the handkerchief, I still have that,<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>
I have kept it so that the child might have something
that belonged to her parents. However, all that stuff
was better than nothing; I took the bundle and they were
already turning me out of the room with my nursling,
when I remembered that I didn’t know anybody’s
name.</p>

<p>“‘Well, monsieur, what’s the little one’s name, and
yours, and your wife’s?’</p>

<p>“At that the gentleman made a funny kind of face; he
hesitated a long while, as if he was trying to think what
answer he could make, and finally he said:</p>

<p>“‘The child’s name is Evelina&mdash;Evelina de Paulausky.&mdash;Now
go; I will write to you.’</p>

<p>“At that he pushed me out with the child and the
bundle. I started back the same day; and since then,
and that was three years ago, not a word from the child’s
parents. Evelina they called her, but we found that
name too long and too hard to pronounce, and so, as the
child when she was a year old, loved violets and could
pick them as she rolled about on the grass, why we just
called her Violette; you can call her so too, if you choose.
She answers to that name better than to Evelina!”</p>

<p>That is what the nurse had told the good woman who
took Violette to Paris. That charitable person was by
no means wealthy, but she had given the child some education.
Violette had learned to read, to write, and to do
some kinds of sewing, but her protectress died before she
was very learned. The child was only eleven when she
lost her.<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a></p>

<p>Being left alone and without resources, and having
too much pride to beg her bread, she went from door to
door, to all the people in the quarter, saying:</p>

<p>“Please give me something to do; I am able to work;
I know how to knit and sew; I will do anything you
want, but employ me, I beg you, for I would rather starve
to death than beg and live on the charity of passers-by.”</p>

<p>These words indicated a certain pride and a lofty
spirit; they indicated above all else Violette’s horror of
idleness, which is the most dangerous of all faults. They
were worth more than a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p>A dealer in fruit said to her:</p>

<p>“I know a lady who is looking for a young maid to
take her little ones to walk. I will give you her address,
you can go to see her, and perhaps she’ll hire you. But
oh, dear! I am afraid that she’ll think you a little too
young.&mdash;How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Eleven.”</p>

<p>“You must tell her you’re fourteen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I won’t lie, madame; my protectress always
told me that that was a very wicked habit.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my girl, anyone can see that you are young! If
you pass your life without lying, you’ll be a famous
phenomenon, and they’ll exhibit you later for two sous.
However, that’s your business. You can do as you
choose.”</p>

<p>Violette went to see the lady who was looking for a
young nursemaid. Her first question, as she looked at
Violette, was:<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>And when the girl told her the truth, she dismissed
her, saying:</p>

<p>“Why, you are much too young! You are only a
child yourself; how do you expect me to give you my
children to take care of?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am very prudent, very sensible for my age,
madame; inquire at number thirty-two; and then you
can give me whatever you please, madame, I don’t care;
so long as I can live without begging, that is all I ask.”</p>

<p>These last words caused the lady to reflect, for there
are people who calculate closely on every subject, even
when the welfare of their children is concerned; such
people are ordinarily the ones who consider it very hard
that dogs are ordered to be muzzled. She called Violette
back and said:</p>

<p>“Come again to-morrow; I will make inquiries at the
house you mention.”</p>

<p>The next day Violette became nursemaid, with a hundred
francs a year. That sum seemed enormous to the
child, who would have taken the place for nothing if
it had been suggested to her. And as her mistress lived
on Rue de Bondy, she took the two little girls of three
or four years to walk every day on the Boulevard, near
the Château d’Eau. When it was the day for the flower
market, Violette never failed to take the children there,
and then she was very happy, for she adored flowers,
and even if she had not the means to buy any, on that
day she could see them and gaze at them at her leisure.<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p>More than three years passed thus. Violette’s mistress
had never had to find fault with her little maid, for
she had never left for a single instant the children whom
it was her duty to take to walk. However, her wages
were not increased; to be sure, Violette did not ask for
an increase, and to obtain distinction in this world, it is
not sufficient to behave oneself well, to have merit or
talent&mdash;one must ask, ask, and then&mdash;ask. And as people
who are out of the line do not understand that, they
prefer to be undistinguished except by their talent.</p>

<p>The mother of the two little girls whom Violette had
in charge left Paris and France; she took her children,
but did not take the young nurse. So that Violette was
left once more without a home and without occupation.
While waiting until chance should throw employment in
her way, the girl as a matter of habit went to the Boulevard
du Château d’Eau, where she had taken the children
so often; and on market days she stopped in front of
the flowers and sometimes remained there all day long.</p>

<p>One day, one of the flower women, an honest old soul,
who had often noticed the little nurse when she was
taking the two children to walk, said to Violette, who
seemed to be admiring her bouquets:</p>

<p>“Well, my girl, what have you done with the brats
that you always brought here to walk? For I know you,
I have looked after you very often; and bless my soul,
it don’t seem to me that anyone had any reason to complain
of you. You didn’t run about from one place to
another. You didn’t talk with a lot of people, as most<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
of the nurses do that have children to take care of! Mon
Dieu! if nothing happens to the young ones, it isn’t the
fault of those young women, who attend to everything
else except the children that are in their care!”</p>

<p>“Alas! madame, my mistress has gone to England
with her children.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t want to leave your country, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I would have been glad to go with madame, but
she didn’t choose to take me!”</p>

<p>“And she left you like that, without getting another
place for you&mdash;a girl of your age, who took such good
care of her little ones? Ah! that isn’t right, that isn’t.
That mistress of yours can’t be good for much!&mdash;But
what are you doing now, my child?”</p>

<p>“I am looking for another place, madame, but I haven’t
found it yet. Luckily I saved money at my mistress’s;
I earned a hundred francs a year!”</p>

<p>“Is that all? Well, upon my word! she wasn’t very
generous, that mistress of yours!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I had quite enough; I didn’t spend anything
except to dress myself; and now I have some clothes
and sixty francs of my own; I spend so little to live; I
get along with five or six sous a day.”</p>

<p>“Poor child! In that case, you’re not much of a
glutton; why, you must live on bread and water.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, I have a sou’s worth of milk every
morning; bread dipped in milk is so good!”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! It is good for those who like milk!
But no matter, that diet will soon take away your fresh<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
color. I say, you must be very fond of flowers to look
at them so long, as if you wanted to kiss them!”</p>

<p>“Flowers! oh! I am mad over them, madame, I am
never tired of gazing at them.”</p>

<p>“So, so! and how would you like to sell them, to
make bouquets as I do?”</p>

<p>“Make bouquets! live among flowers! you ask me if
I would like that? Oh, madame! that would be the
happiest life for me. It seems to me that one has nothing
more to wish for when one is a flower girl!”</p>

<p>“Well, my child, sit down here, by my side. I am
alone, I have no children, and no one depending on me;
I am beginning not to be so smart as I used to be; if
you choose to stay with me and always be as good&mdash;as&mdash;as
you were when you took the two little girls to walk,
why, I will keep you, I will give you part of my profits;
in fact, I will make a flower girl of you; does that suit
you?”</p>

<p>“Does it suit me,&mdash;to be a flower girl! such a pleasant
trade! Is it really true, madame? You are not making
fun of me?”</p>

<p>“As true as my name is Mère Gazon; and yours?”</p>

<p>“My name is Violette.”</p>

<p>“Violette! You see you were destined to be a flower
girl.”</p>

<p>So Violette took her place beside Mère Gazon; and
she was so pleased with the skill and taste with which
the girl made her bouquets, that she congratulated herself
every day upon having taken her into her employ.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p>Violette reached the age of fifteen, sixteen, and became
so pretty and her figure assumed such graceful proportions
that people began to notice the young flower girl,
and Mère Gazon’s business constantly increased. Then
came the lady-killers, the oglers, the gallants, who tried
to make love to Violette, but she did not listen to them,
or at all events paid no heed to what they said. Moreover,
Mère Gazon was there and said to those who paid
her companion compliments:</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, let the child alone! You see well
enough that you bother her with your fine words, without
head or tail! Go and get your hair curled, that would
be better.”</p>

<p>But one night, Mère Gazon, who had rather abused
currant brandy, which she adored as a cordial, felt an
oppression that compelled her to keep her bed. The
next day she was worse, and she said to her young companion:</p>

<p>“My dear Violette, I believe I am going to pack up
and not open shop any more. I leave you all I have; my
stock, my flowers, my furniture, my customers. Always
be honest and virtuous, don’t let anyone cajole you and
I have an idea that you will prosper. If I myself had
been more prudent with currant brandy, I might have
kept shop much longer! but never mind! that’s a small
matter! I am glad, at all events, to have you with me to
close my eyes.”</p>

<p>That is Violette’s whole story; that is how the little
girl abandoned by her parents had become a flower girl.<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br /><br />
<small>GEORGET AND CHICOTIN</small></h2>

<p>“We would like a magnificent bouquet, mademoiselle,”
said Madame Glumeau to Violette.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mademoiselle Eolinde, “a su&mdash;su&mdash;superb
bou&mdash;bou&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That isn’t all,” said Monsieur Astianax, doing his
utmost to look at the pretty flower girl with both eyes at
once. “I wish to express a certain meaning in presenting
a bouquet to my father, so that the flowers
must interpret my meaning; I would like a <i>selam</i>, mademoiselle;
give me a <i>selam</i>.”</p>

<p>Violette stared at him as she replied:</p>

<p>“I don’t know that flower, monsieur; does it grow in
boxes or in pots?”</p>

<p>“A <i>selam</i> is not a single flower, mademoiselle; it is
an arrangement of flowers, which means something particular;
it’s an oriental bouquet.”</p>

<p>“I have no oriental flowers, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t catch my meaning, I mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Astianax, you are insufferable; you
will keep us here two hours when you know that we are
in a hurry; select yourself the flowers that you want, and
she will make them into a bouquet for you.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>”</p>

<p>Monsieur Astianax, confused by the flower girl’s lovely
eyes, turned very red and began to rummage among the
flowers on the counter, stammering:</p>

<p>“But I don’t see&mdash;I am looking&mdash;I don’t find&mdash;I would
like&mdash;haven’t you got any?”</p>

<p>“Tell me what flowers you want, monsieur; that will
be better than upsetting my whole stock.”</p>

<p>But the little fellow could not admire the pretty flower
girl enough, and he had no idea what he wanted.</p>

<p>The porter who had in his arms the box with the pomegranate,
which was very heavy, and the rosebush, which
was not light, said to Madame Glumeau:</p>

<p>“If you’re going to be here long, lady, I am going to
get a basket to put these things in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! it isn’t worth while, messenger; we are going
at once.&mdash;Well, my son, have you chosen your flowers?”</p>

<p>“I don’t find what I am looking for.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! Eolinde, is not that Cousin Michonnard,
standing over there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, mamma, it is she.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if she sees us, we are lost; she will follow us
wherever we go; we shall not be able to get rid of her,
for she is quite capable of inviting herself to dinner.
You know that your father doesn’t like her because she
always says that he doesn’t look well. Let’s go along
at once before she sees us.&mdash;Come, Astianax.”</p>

<p>“But my dear mother, I haven’t any bouquet.”</p>

<p>“It is your own fault, you take too long to decide.
You can present your father with a Savoy cake with his<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
monogram, that will be just as respectful. Come, come!&mdash;Follow
us, messenger.”</p>

<p>And this time, without listening to the remonstrances
of her son, who declared that a cake did not express his
meaning, the stout lady took his arm and dragged him
away, but not until the little fellow had darted a random
glance in Violette’s direction. In a few moments the
Glumeau family had disappeared.</p>

<p>Thereupon, a young man in a blouse, with a cap on his
head, and with a shrewd, clever face and a slender figure
which denoted sixteen years at most, although he was
past seventeen, began to laugh as he looked at the pretty
flower girl, beside whom he had stopped, and said to her:</p>

<p>“Well, my word! there’s customers for you! They
come here and handle and move your flowers and spoil
them, and then go away without buying anything.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Monsieur Georget, that’s the way it is in
business; one can’t always sell.”</p>

<p>“But the young man would have liked to stay, I fancy.
What eyes he made at you, zigzag! A man shouldn’t be
allowed to squint like that! I am sure it would exempt
him from the conscription; for when a man looks all
ways at once, he can hardly fire straight at the enemy.&mdash;But
no matter, you have turned his head.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! to hear you, Georget, one would think
that everybody is in love with me!”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems to me that you don’t lack suitors and
gallants. There are days when a fellow can’t get near
your shop, there are so many people around you!<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a>”</p>

<p>“I have no reason to complain, that is true. I sell a
great deal. My bouquets seem to please.”</p>

<p>“Oh! your bouquets&mdash;and yourself too. When the
dealer is good-looking, that makes business good; and
deuce take it! you are mighty good-looking.”</p>

<p>“You know very well, Georget, that nothing tires me
so much as compliments!”</p>

<p>“Then you must get tired very often! you receive them
all day!”</p>

<p>“I can’t prevent the gentlemen who buy flowers of me
from talking nonsense to me! but it seems to me that
you might get along without it.”</p>

<p>“So what I say to you is nonsense, is it?”</p>

<p>“Instead of idling away your time every market day,
walking back and forth in front of my stand, wouldn’t
you do better to work?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you don’t like to have me stop
in front of your shop sometimes, mamzelle?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say that, but I ask you if you would not do
better to work.”</p>

<p>“All right, mamzelle, that’s enough. I won’t stand
near you any more, never fear! If you don’t like it, why,
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! how wrong-headed you are, Monsieur Georget!
a body can’t give you a little advice, eh?”</p>

<p>But the young messenger was no longer listening to
the pretty flower girl; he walked away with a very pronounced
frown, and sat down upon one of the steps of
the Château d’Eau. He had hardly settled down when<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a>
another youngster of nineteen, tall, strong and active,
with his cap cocked over one ear in true roistering
fashion, came and stood in front of him, crying:</p>

<p>“Ah! here’s Georget! here’s my little Georget! I am
glad of that; I thought he must have been swallowed
by the whale on exhibition over yonder, behind us. To
be sure, I know that it isn’t alive; but never mind, you
might have crawled into its mouth. I say, Georget, have
you seen the whale?”</p>

<p>“Let me alone, I don’t feel like talking!”</p>

<p>“Well! I paid to see the whale, because as I’d never
seen the sea, I said to myself: ‘That will give me an idea
of its inhabitants.’&mdash;But confound it! how I was sold!
Just fancy&mdash;I went into a long, narrow place, like a corridor
with boarded walls. I couldn’t see anything, no
water at all. I said to myself: ‘Where in the deuce is
the whale?’ but there was a fellow in a sailor’s suit,
walking up and down the corridor, singing out at the
top of his lungs: ‘See, ladies and gentlemen, look, examine
this rare animal! It’s the first whale that’s been
seen in France since the Roman conquest! It was harpooned
at Havre and would have been brought to Paris
alive, if there had been room enough for it in a first-class
carriage!’&mdash;When I heard that, I squinted up my
eyes to find the marine monster. When I first went into
the corridor, I had noticed something like a pile of earth,
on the floor between two boards, and I said to myself:
‘It seems that they are going to plant flowers in the
place to brighten it up!’ But not at all: that black<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>
thing, between two boards, was the whale! I discovered
it when I reached the end of the corridor, because
then I saw a kind of head, with a beard, at one end of
what I had taken for earth. I was mad, I tell you! I
regretted my money, and I said to the sailor: ‘If you’d
told me beforehand that I was going to see a whale in a
box, and dry as a herring, I wouldn’t have come into
your old barrack!’&mdash;Well, little Georget, why don’t you
laugh?”</p>

<p>“I tell you to let me alone, I don’t feel like laughing!”</p>

<p>“Why, what under the sun is the matter with the little
mummy! He’s got to be as melancholy as an empty
stomach for some time past! Come, I propose to cheer
you up; I’ll treat you to a glass at the wine merchant’s
on Rue Basse.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I am not thirsty.”</p>

<p>“And then you will come to the theatre this evening
with me. I don’t mean the Délasses, or the Funambs,
or the Petit-Lazare; I go to the big theatres now; I
have become an habitué of the Folies-Dramatiques!
Nothing less! You see, when one has seen Mamzelle
Duplessis, in <i>‘Une Mauvaise Nuit Est Bientôt Passée,’</i>
one doesn’t care to see anything else! It is magnificent!
Mamzelle Duplessis is in a night jacket embroidered with
lace, like a bride preparing to retire. Dieu! how lovely
she is! I dream of her every night as I go to bed! And
then, Monsieur Christian, in <i>‘La Perruque de Mon
Oncle!’</i> When he says: ‘Ah! fichtre! sacrebleu! hush
or I will thrash you!’ or something else in that line, I<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
tell you it’s amusing! I laugh until I make a show of
myself! And just now Monsieur Christian passed here&mdash;you
didn’t see him&mdash;the real man, the one who plays
at the Folies; and he bought a bunch of violets, and
smiled because I said to him: ‘Monsieur Christian, do
you want me to carry you?’&mdash;Ha! ha! that made him
laugh!&mdash;Well, Georget, I say, Georget! you little wretch
of a Georget! what in the world has somebody been
doing to you, Gringalet?”</p>

<p>“If you call me Gringalet, I’ll punch your head, do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“Oho! how ugly the little rascal is! What have you
been treading on to-day?”</p>

<p>“I may be small without being a Gringalet, or a
wretch. I am seventeen years, eight months and ten
days.”</p>

<p>“You look as if you were about twelve or less!”</p>

<p>“The looks make no difference; I am not a child any
more, and I don’t propose to be treated like an urchin.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you wish to be looked up to, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“If anyone insults me, he must fight me.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you have eaten this morning? You
are not so ugly as this usually!”</p>

<p>“But you are teasing me! saying things that make
me angry!”</p>

<p>“Then as I am in the wrong, thrash me right away
and let’s have it over with! But I don’t propose to
fight with you, because I am your friend, and I like you
with all your ill-humor! Come, strike me!<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Chicotin Patatras&mdash;for such was the name
of this last individual&mdash;coolly planted himself in front of
his friend, and stooped as if he were all ready to be
beaten. But when he saw that, Georget rose, his anger
vanished, and he offered his hand to his comrade, saying:</p>

<p>“Can you think of such a thing? I, strike you! that
would be pretty! Come, it is all over, I am not angry
any more; nor you either, are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I haven’t been at all!”</p>

<p>“You see, Chicotin, there are many people who say
that you are a ne’er-do-well, a brawler, and a sot; they
have nicknamed you Patatras, because wherever you go,
you always arrive like a bomb and turn everything topsy-turvy!
But I do you justice, and I have always defended
you; and if you are noisy, and if you do sometimes throw
a whole company into confusion, you have a good heart
all the same, and when you are fond of anybody, he can
always rely on you.”</p>

<p>“Pardi! a man is a good friend, or he isn’t. A door
is open or shut, one or the other! that’s all I know!&mdash;Well,
will you go to the Folies-Dramatiques with me to-night?
I’ll treat you; I have some cash; I carried a
bouquet to the young lady! Ah! bless my soul! that
bouquet evidently gave pleasure, for she put five francs
in my hand; the gentleman had given me as much! in
all, two hind wheels, six times as much as the bouquet
was worth! But these lovers! tell me who else is so
generous, when they are satisfied, and are in funds? ‘Tis
love, love, love, that makes the world go round!<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! the rich lovers, they are happy enough!
they can make their sweethearts handsome presents!”</p>

<p>“Bah! they are not the ones I envy, especially as I
have noticed that the ones who are loved the best are
not the ones who give the most presents! A little more
pains is taken to deceive them, that’s all! I see so many
things, when I am doing errands, opening carriage doors,
or asking for theatre checks! But the actors! Oh, the
actors! when I can be employed by one of them, then
I am perfectly happy! I went on the stage once, that
is to say, under the stage, at the Ambigu! It’s mighty
amusing, I tell you, and you see a lot of things&mdash;that
you don’t expect to see!&mdash;But you are not listening to
me, Georget. Ah! I can guess what you’re thinking
about, with your eyes always turned in that direction!
So it is all over, is it? You’re in love for good and all!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Chicotin, don’t say that, I beg you!”</p>

<p>“I say it because I see it; I don’t need to be a sleep-walker
to guess that! You’re in love with the pretty
flower girl, Mamzelle Violette!”</p>

<p>“I never told anybody so!”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to tell it, it’s plain enough; that’s
what upsets you so, and changes your whole disposition,
and gives you a sour look, a dismal expression, like
Monsieur Goujet of the Gaîté, when he plays the traitors,
the abductors who carry off young girls! Ah! how
magnificent he was in <i>‘Martin et Bamboche!’</i> I was
a little bit of a fellow when I saw that, but I still have
the piece in my head all the same, it impressed me so.<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>
He had on a white coat, rather neat, did Monsieur Goujet;
he played the part of a well-dressed son, who treated his
father like the deuce!&mdash;Confound it! He isn’t listening
to me because I’ve stopped talking about the flower girl!
Why, is this passion of yours making you an idiot? As
if a man ever fell in love for good at your age! For
my part, I like pretty girls too; but it doesn’t make me
so stupid as it does you! it never lasts more than a week!
Let your beard grow, then you’ll have the right to pose
as a sentimental lover! Ah! now he turns as red as a
turkey-cock! What is going on? Ah! I see; because
two fine gentlemen, two swells have stopped and are
looking at the flower girl’s wares. I suppose you’d like
it if nobody ever bought anything of your pretty dealer?
She’d do a fine business then!”</p>

<p>“Oh! but I know those two young men; they come
very often to buy flowers of her and they always talk
nonsense to her; especially the tallest one! He actually
dared one time to ask her to be his mistress! Ah! if
big Chopard hadn’t held me back, I’d have jumped on
him; I’d have scratched him and bitten him!”</p>

<p>“Hoity-toity! is that the way you propose to treat
Mamzelle Violette’s customers? You’ll give her shop a
good reputation!”</p>

<p>“That’s what Chopard said, to calm me down!”</p>

<p>“Besides, don’t all these dandies&mdash;that is what they
call these fellows&mdash;don’t all these dandies talk that way
to women, especially when they are pretty? It’s their
way; they must always play the lady-killer; if they<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>
didn’t, they wouldn’t be dandies! But I know one of
those young men, too; the tallest one is an author,&mdash;that
means a man who writes plays; his name is Jéricourt;
I’ve carried letters to his room sometimes from
the other one, who isn’t so tall; that one has employed
me often; just now he’s very attentive to an actress at
the Folies, a little blonde with black eyes, who plays such
parts as Rigolette,&mdash;Mademoiselle Dutaillis. I’ll bet that
she’s the one he’s going to buy a bouquet for, and then
he’ll take her to dinner at Bonvalet’s; and when she’s
in the cast, they keep sending me to the theatre, to the
box office, to ask how far they have got. I always ask
a handsome man who is sitting inside the office, and he
answers with a sly look: ‘Go and tell mademoiselle that
she has time enough to eat another course, provided that
it isn’t carp, because the bones might make her lose her
cue.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I know well enough that it isn’t the light-haired
one who is dangerous to Violette; it’s the other
one!”</p>

<p>“And why should the other one be dangerous, when
everyone says that the little flower girl is virtuous? You
yourself told me so a hundred times.”</p>

<p>“Certainly she is virtuous, perfectly virtuous. If she
wasn’t, if she was anything else, do you suppose I’d be
mad over her as I am?”</p>

<p>“Then what difference does it make to you whether
people pay her compliments and make love to her? She
won’t listen to them.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>”</p>

<p>“Who can tell? A young girl sometimes ends by
allowing herself to be deceived by all these soft speeches.
They offer her dresses, jewels, entertainments, love&mdash;it’s
all very tempting. Look, see how that tall, scented fellow
is leaning over her counter to speak to her! I don’t care;
no matter what happens, I am going to tell that man to
act different from that!”</p>

<p>“Upon my word! be good enough to stay here. You
don’t like to see him talking with the flower girl; very
good, let me fix him; I haven’t been nicknamed Patatras
for nothing!”</p>

<small>TWO WELL-KNOWN YOUNG MEN</small></h2>

<p>Two young men had, in fact, stopped in front of the
pretty flower girl’s booth; each of them was from twenty-six
to twenty-eight years of age; their eccentric costumes
marked them out as dandies, or at least as persons
who strove to appear to be such.</p>

<p>Especially the shorter one, who wore plaid trousers
of very bright colors, each plaid being so large that a
single one extended from the thigh to the calf; his light
sack coat hardly came below his waist, and when he bent
forward a little, disclosed the whole seat of his trousers.
He wore on his head a broad-brimmed gray hat with a<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
long nap; and he had stuck in one eye a small bit of
glass, set in tortoise shell, which, when not in use, hung
down over his waistcoat of buff piqué, at the end of
a black ribbon. He was, for all this dandified equipment,
a very good-looking youth, with black eyes, a shapely
aquiline nose, a small mouth with red lips, fine teeth,
a pretty pink and white complexion, a little dimple in
his chin, very light whiskers, a pointed beard, and with
all that, a stupid expression which was not in the least
misleading.</p>

<p>This young man had been a clerk in a business house
with a salary of eight hundred francs, and a slight bonus
at the end of the year; at that time, as may be imagined,
his dress was much less elegant, and it was difficult for
him to follow the fashions. But a distant relative died,
and unexpectedly left him sixty thousand francs in cash.
This unhoped-for fortune, which enabled him to gratify
his dearest wishes, his fondest hopes, had almost turned
his brain.</p>

<p>First of all, he began by correcting his certificates of
baptism; his name was Benoît Canard, a name which
struck the ear unpleasantly, and had nothing romantic or
refined about it; he adopted the name of Alfred de Saint-Arthur,
which was certain to attract the attention of the
ladies. When a man’s name is Alfred de Saint-Arthur,
he must inevitably belong to the <i>haute</i>, as the lorettes of
the Bréda quarter say.</p>

<p>Next, Alfred soon resigned his place, hired a dainty
apartment, purchased a cabriolet and a horse, and<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>
patronized one of the first tailors in Paris; he affected
the society of actresses, choosing those who were most
talked about, and who had led their lovers into the most
follies; for, although Monsieur Alfred de Saint-Arthur
had some inclination for that life of dissipation, of parade
and extravagances which some favorites of fortune lead,
and which is excusable only in those who really have the
means to support it, the thing that especially delighted
the young man was to show himself, to put himself in
evidence with a fashionable woman, to display himself
in the proscenium box of a theatre, or in a calèche in the
Bois du Boulogne; to make a great noise when he entered
a restaurant, to declare all the private rooms inconvenient,
to shout at the waiters, to find fault with everything,
always to talk very loud, so that everybody might
hear him, to smoke only eight sou cigars, and to see
everybody turn to look at him when he was out driving.</p>

<p>In a word, what Alfred desired was to create a sensation;
the same pleasures, enjoyed in private, without
show, without witnesses, or in curtained boxes at the
theatre, would have seemed to him tasteless, insipid and
of no account; but to attract attention, to cause a sensation,
to be noticed on entering a theatre or a concert
hall, was to him supreme happiness. He did not suspect
that many people said when they saw him:</p>

<p>“They say that he has already run through thirty
thousand francs with her!”</p>

<p>“I believe him to be quite enough of a fool for that!
Indeed, he looks it!<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>”</p>

<p>“What an utterly absurd costume!”</p>

<p>And it was to procure this reputation that young
Alfred had run through more than thirty thousand francs
in one year; that was more than half of the fortune he
had inherited. If he continued to live in the same way,
he had not enough for another year; but once started
on the path of folly, some people keep on, not knowing
how to stop. The crash which awaits them, and in which
they will involve some too confiding friends, is there before
them, inevitable, if they persist in following the
same road; they know it, and still they go on. Are they
fools or knaves? they necessarily deserve both titles.</p>

<p>The other individual was not so good-looking as Monsieur
Alfred de Saint-Arthur, but he had not his stupid
look; indeed, there was in his eyes a shrewd expression
which sometimes turned to mockery. Neither his trousers
nor his coat were so exaggerated as his friend’s, but
all the world did not turn to look at him; he had no
fashionable mistress upon whom he squandered money,
but he strove to be on the best terms with the mistresses
of his friends; he did not waste his fortune, because he
had none, and he had not left his place, because he had
never had any.</p>

<p>However, as one must needs try, in society, to have
some talent, some profession, or some rank, in default
of fortune, Jéricourt had become an author. He had not
stopped to consider whether he had the necessary vocation
and intellect for that; he had said to himself: “I
propose to be an author;” and as one ordinarily<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
effects his purpose by dint of perseverance and unbounded
self-assurance, Jéricourt, by persistently frequenting
the café where the young men who write for
the stage ordinarily gather, had insinuated himself among
them, playing billiards with one, dominoes with another;
he had become one of their intimates, and then had begun
to talk of plays, of plots, of original ideas which he
claimed to have had; and when someone would say to
him:</p>

<p>“That is old, that subject has already been treated
fifty times!” he would exclaim:</p>

<p>“I don’t see why it shouldn’t be treated fifty-one times!
A thing that has succeeded so often will succeed again.
It is mere folly to try to do something new; one risks
failure; whereas, by following roads already marked
out, one is certain to arrive without hindrance.”</p>

<p>Jéricourt found people of his opinion; and thus it was
that he became an author by revamping what others had
done before him. And he ended by believing himself to
be an inventor, a man of genius, and by making idiots
of the type of his friend Saint-Arthur believe it also.
The number of fools is infinite!</p>

<p>“Well, my pretty flower girl, I must have a wonderful,
a stupendous bouquet!” said Alfred, halting in front
of Violette; “it’s for a lady who knows what’s what, and
who has already had the most beautiful bouquets that
are made in Paris,&mdash;isn’t that so, Jéricourt?&mdash;<i>Sapristi!</i>
I haven’t a cigar; Jéricourt, my dear fellow, make me a
cigarette, will you?<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>”</p>

<p>“You don’t like them.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it is true that I have become so accustomed to
panatelas&mdash;I say! look at that little woman yonder! She
turned around to look at me. If I weren’t in such a
hurry, I’d follow her.”</p>

<p>“Aha! would you be unfaithful to Zizi Dutaillis?”</p>

<p>“Oh! pardieu! a little amourette of a moment.&mdash;Make
me a cigarette.&mdash;Well, flower girl! you don’t show me
anything.”</p>

<p>“Why, monsieur, you see what I have; choose for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Choose for myself! why, all this stuff is horrible!
these bouquets are good for nobody but circus riders!
I don’t want any of these. I told you that I wanted
something wonderful, such a bouquet as never yet was
seen.”</p>

<p>“I will make you up one!”</p>

<p>“All right! but hurry. Zizi is waiting for me, and
she doesn’t like to wait; her nerves are all upset when
I am late.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my boy. Have you fire?”</p>

<p>“Always, when I am before this fascinating flower girl.
Pray look at those eyes! did you ever see anything more
alluring?”</p>

<p>“True! for a flower girl’s eyes, they are very fair.”</p>

<p>“And that nose, that mouth, and that cruel air, which
would be so becoming to her if it were not genuine!”</p>

<p>“Ah! mademoiselle is cruel, is she?<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>”</p>

<p>“Alas! yes, my dear Alfred.&mdash;Would you believe that
for nearly a month I have been sighing at her feet, and
without making any progress?”</p>

<p>“The deuce, my boy, you don’t know how to go about
it! You tempt me to try my hand with the flower girl.
If I should undertake it, I will wager that the affair
would go faster,&mdash;eh, my girl?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Alfred tried to take Violette’s arm; but
she struck him across the fingers with a bunch of roses
and lilacs that she held; and as there were some thorns
in the bunch, the young dandy made a wry face as he
withdrew his hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Bigre!</i> she has scratched my fingers! Is this flower
girl a Lucretia?”</p>

<p>“I told you that she resisted me, and yet you choose
to meddle!”</p>

<p>“She plays the prude; but if I had time! I am terribly
afraid of being late. Zizi will be angry; she plays to-night,
and she is much more nervous when she plays!
You are coming to dine with us, Jéricourt, are you
not?”</p>

<p>“Impossible.”</p>

<p>“Bah! why impossible?”</p>

<p>“Because I dine with this lovely girl, with the flower
girl.&mdash;Isn’t it true, Violette, that you will dine with
me to-day?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I thought that I answered you the other
day in such a way that you would not give me any more
such invitations.<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>”</p>

<p>“My dear love, you are too fascinating to remain
virtuous long; why shouldn’t you give me the preference?
I will give you your own apartment, pretty
furniture, pretty dresses; the theatre every evening;
that’s the life that awaits you!”</p>

<p>“I prefer to sell my bouquets, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“That’s absurd! Unless you have some passion that
closes your heart to me, you ought to yield to me.”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, I feel no sort of obligation to you.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! poor Jéricourt! he fails in his suit to
a flower girl! That will make Zizi laugh! I’ll tell her
at dinner.&mdash;I say, my pretty girl, don’t make my bouquet
all white, please. The other day I offered one like that
to Zizi, and she declared that it looked like a cauliflower.”</p>

<p>“There, monsieur, how is this? Do you like it?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it isn’t bad; it has some style! I think
that it will produce an effect.&mdash;Come,&mdash;Jéricourt, as Mademoiselle
Violette refuses to dine with you, it seems to
me that you can accept my invitation. If I don’t bring
you, Zizi will be sulky; she is much livelier when you
are there; that is easily understood, for you make her
laugh, you make puns, and she declares that there is no
such thing as a good dinner without puns.”</p>

<p>“I tell you again, Alfred, that Mademoiselle Violette
will not be inexorable; why, I propose to launch her in
society, to make her the fashion, for I have all the small
newspapers at my disposal.”</p>

<p>“He is telling you the truth, my girl, and the small
newspapers are the only ones that are read nowadays,<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>
for they are much more amusing than the large ones.
For my part, I know nothing better than the <i>Tintamarre</i>!
Dieu! the <i>Tintamarre</i>; there’s a newspaper that always
drives away the blues! I learn puns from it and I repeat
them to Zizi; but unfortunately I don’t remember
them very well, so that she doesn’t understand them.&mdash;Ah!
what a beautiful bouquet!&mdash;Well, my dear fellow,
will you come?”</p>

<p>And the pretty young man with the light whiskers,
holding his enormous bouquet in one hand, tried with
the other to lead away his friend, who, half leaning over
the flower girl’s counter, was gazing at her with his
face close to hers, although she did her utmost to move
away from him.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Chicotin Patatras, who had
spied one of his cronies a few steps from Violette’s booth,
ran to him and tripped him up,&mdash;a method of beginning
a conversation decidedly fashionable among street urchins.
The friend, taken by surprise, fell upon the sidewalk,
and as he rose, saw Chicotin laughing and making
fun of him, and apparently challenging him to retaliate.
He immediately started to run after him, which was
what young Patatras hoped that he would do. When he
saw that his comrade was about to overtake him, he
jumped back in such a way as to collide with the persons
who stood in front of Violette’s booth.</p>

<p>Chicotin had hoped to fall on Jéricourt, but having
failed to calculate the distance accurately, he collided
violently with the young dandy, Alfred de Saint-Arthur.<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>
The shock was so sudden and so unexpected by Alfred,
whose back was turned to the passers-by, that he fell
forward with his face against the flower girl’s wares;
and as the counter was not strong enough to hold the
weight of his body, it collapsed under the young man.</p>

<p>Violette uttered a loud exclamation when she saw her
flowers scattered over the concrete, and Monsieur de
Saint-Arthur apparently trying to swim among them.</p>

<p>Jéricourt, taken by surprise by this unexpected mishap,
also received a kick or two from Chicotin, for the latter,
still pursued by his comrade, who finally overtook him,
began with him a struggle which was all in jest, but in
which, although they were merely fooling, the young
men dealt each other blows so lustily applied that everybody
who was near them received some.</p>

<p>“Will you stop, or go somewhere else and fight, you
clowns?” cried Jéricourt. “Just look at what you have
done! All of the girl’s flowers are on the ground!”</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s that good-for-nothing Patatras again!” said
Violette; “he is always doing something of the kind;
he must always be making trouble somewhere! It’s outrageous;
I am going to complain to the inspector.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg pardon, excuse me, Mamzelle Violette,”
said Chicotin, rising, “you must know that I didn’t fall
against your stall on purpose. It’s Chopard’s fault; why
did he chase me when I tried to get out of the way behind
your customers?”</p>

<p>“Why did you come and trip me up when I wasn’t
saying anything to you?<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it again when I choose, you long <i>bobêche</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! just come and try! I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! are you going to begin again, you scoundrels,
instead of picking up these bouquets which you
knocked down?”</p>

<p>“But your friend has fallen too, monsieur, and he
doesn’t get up!&mdash;Help him! Perhaps he’s hurt himself!”</p>

<p>At these words from Violette, Jéricourt condescended
at last to pay some attention to his companion; with the
assistance of Chicotin, he succeeded, not without difficulty,
in placing him on his feet; for Alfred was almost
suffocated; two rosebuds had been forced into each
nostril, and had entered far enough to close them hermetically;
and as he had in addition a bunch of gilly-flowers
over his mouth, he could not breathe at all, and
was beginning to turn purple. Once upon his feet, he
opened his mouth as if he proposed to swallow everything
in his neighborhood, and shook his head to try to
rid himself of the two rosebuds, whose thorny stems
tickled the lower part of his face unpleasantly. But he
could not succeed; Jéricourt had to pull one of the stems
and Chicotin the other, to uncork his nose. This operation
was not performed without a number of shrieks
from Monsieur de Saint-Arthur, but his nose at last recovered
its air current, and everybody’s mind was at ease.</p>

<p>When the young dandy recovered all his faculties, the
thing that troubled him most was that he had broken one
of his suspenders, and that his trousers on that side were
not held in place.<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a></p>

<p>“All sorts of misfortunes at once,” cried Alfred; “I
have broken my left suspender. But who was it, then,
who came down on me like a bomb and pushed me onto
that counter?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, master, my excellency, I did it by accident,
and not on purpose, for I was fooling with
Chopard.”</p>

<p>“What, you scoundrel, was it you?&mdash;Ah! I recognize
you; I have employed you more than once.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I remember very well! You are one of those
generous and distinguished gentlemen that a man doesn’t
forget. I have often opened your carriage door, master,
and you are always with such pretty ladies, ladies from
the theatre, and so well dressed, that everybody looks at
you. Shall I wait at Monsieur Bonvalet’s, master, to
see if you want to send me to find out how far they’ve
got in the play?”</p>

<p>“All right, all right, we’ll see. After all, as he didn’t
do it on purpose&mdash;And my bouquet, what became of that
in the scrimmage?”</p>

<p>“Here it is, monsieur,” said Violette; “luckily nothing
happened to it.”</p>

<p>“It’s my broken suspender that worries me most; my
trousers are all creased on that side! I’d give thirty
francs for a pair of suspenders.”</p>

<p>“Would you like mine, master?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks! That would look nice!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and buy you a pair at the druggist’s on Rue
du Temple.<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>”</p>

<p>“What does the idiot say?” muttered Jéricourt; “suspenders
at a druggist’s! do you propose to buy them
made of marshmallow paste?”</p>

<p>“At all events I can’t stop here any longer,” cried
Alfred; “Zizi will make a horrible row; she will be in
an infernal humor; and if she sees that my trousers are
creased, it will be much worse! And she will see it, for
she always looks at them first when I join her; she is
so particular about dress; she said to me once: ‘A man
who doesn’t have morocco straps to his boots shall never
step foot inside my door!’&mdash;Well, Jéricourt, are you
coming?”</p>

<p>Tall Jéricourt decided at last to go away with his
friend; for the flower girl, busily engaged in picking up
her flowers, did not seem disposed to laugh, and he saw
that he must needs abandon the idea of being listened
to for that day at least. So he walked away, arm-in-arm
with Alfred de Saint-Arthur, who, as he walked, did his
utmost to hold his trousers up. When he saw the two
young men take their leave, Chicotin Patatras nodded his
head to Georget, who was not very far away, and who
answered with a smile. And Violette, as she tried to replace
her flowers in order upon her counter, did not fail
to notice that pantomime.<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a></p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br /><br />
<small>A CONCIERGE’S LODGE</small></h2>

<p>In a house of respectable appearance on Rue d’Angoulême,
about half-past eleven one evening, the street
bell was pulled so violently that it caused Monsieur
Baudoin, the concierge, to leap from his chair, upon
which he was beginning to doze, while his wife Hildegarde
took advantage of his nodding to open a small cupboard
and take therefrom a bottle, the neck of which she
proceeded to introduce into her mouth, and took several
swallows of a fluid which she seemed to enjoy greatly.</p>

<p>Baudoin the concierge was a tall, thin man, with a pale
face and light hair, who had passed his fiftieth year, but
was still very straight, and as active as a young man. To
his occupation of concierge, he added that of clerk in a
stage office, which kept him only until six o’clock. He
was an honest man, to whom one could fearlessly entrust
his house and his treasure; he did promptly whatever he
was ordered to do, unless he did not fully understand;
but in that case it was not safe to reproach him, for
Baudoin lost his temper very readily, having an immeasurable
self-esteem and claiming that he never made
a mistake. When he did lose his temper, Baudoin swore
like a trooper, and turned as red as a turkey-cock.<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<p>Hildegarde, the concierge’s wife, was two or three
years older than her husband; she had once been pretty
and sentimental; she was not very well preserved, and
her inclination to sentiment having with age become diverted
to brandy, Madame Baudoin had neglected herself
considerably; there was a deplorable carelessness in
her dress, which resulted in nothing ever being in place.
Baudoin, who was always neat and decently dressed,
often reproached his wife for her heedlessness in that
respect, and as he had also discovered her unlucky fondness
for liquor, he sometimes added to his reproaches
lessons of an impressive sort, which made Hildegarde
bellow loudly, and promise never to give way again to
her miserable failing; but she never failed to forget that
promise, whenever she thought that her husband would
know nothing about it.</p>

<p>Moreover, Madame Baudoin was a genuine type of
concierge: talkative, inquisitive, gossiping, scandal-loving,
incautious, not evil-minded at bottom, but capable of
setting the whole quarter at odds with remarks made
without ill-intent. Her husband often scolded her for it;
but “what’s bred in the bone will come out in the flesh!”</p>

<p>At the jingling of the bell, and the somersault performed
by her husband, Hildegarde, bewildered, and realizing
that she had not time to replace the bottle of
brandy in the cupboard, hastily put it on the floor between
her feet, and then sat down, thus having her dear
bottle in the place where the open air tradeswomen put
their foot-warmers.<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p>“Didn’t someone ring?” said Baudoin, rubbing his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, yes, someone certainly did!” replied
his wife, without moving from her chair.</p>

<p>“Well, then, draw the cord, Hildegarde; you’re right
near it.”</p>

<p>“You can draw it much easier yourself, my dear; you
have only to put out your arm and lean forward a bit.”</p>

<p>“Look here, why won’t you pull the cord, when you’re
right beside it? What sort of way is that to behave?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, you see I pulled it just now when the
tenant of the first floor came in, so it’s your turn.”</p>

<p>“Ah! so this is a new idea you’ve got into your head!
Madame is afraid that she will pull the cord oftener than
I, who have just come in, all tired and out of breath
after running about Paris all day! What a lazy hussy!”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! is it possible for a man to be as ugly as
this to his wife! to be so unwilling to do anything for
her! Ah! Monsieur Baudoin, how you have changed!”</p>

<p>While this little dialogue was taking place between the
couple employed to take care of the house, the person
who had rung remained at the door, which is rarely pleasing
when one returns home at night. A second peal at
the bell, much more violent than the first, announced that
he was losing patience.</p>

<p>Baudoin decided to pull the cord, but as he did so he
said to his wife:</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>bigre!</i> you shall pay for this, Hildegarde!
by all that’s good! I promise you that.<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>”</p>

<p>Hildegarde made no reply, but continued to sit over
her bottle. Someone came in and closed the street door;
and soon a man appeared at the concierge’s lodge, and
said curtly:</p>

<p>“Give me my light.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, Monsieur Malberg; this minute, Monsieur
Malberg.&mdash;Hildegarde, just take Monsieur Malberg’s
candlestick from the cupboard by you, light it at our
lamp, or rather light it with a match, for the chimney of
our lamp is cracked and it might break in your hand.&mdash;You
are just from the theatre, I suppose, Monsieur Malberg?
They say that they are giving a fine play there
just now; I don’t know which theatre, but no matter,
it seems that it’s fine, all the same! You have been to see
it, of course?”</p>

<p>“I have been where I chose to go, and it is none of
your business,” replied the tenant, in a tone which did
not invite further conversation. “Well! what about my
light? Are you going to give it to me to-night? or do
you intend to keep me waiting here as long as you did in
the street?”</p>

<p>“What, Hildegarde, haven’t you lighted Monsieur Malberg’s
light yet? Look here, what are you about? God
forgive me, Monsieur Malberg, but I believe that my
wife is getting deaf or idiotic; something’s the matter
with her to-night; it isn’t possible&mdash;yes, she may have
been tippling. You know her unlucky failing, which will
lead her to perdition! and it isn’t for lack of my trying
to correct it by every means that I can think of.<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>”</p>

<p>Whereupon Hildegarde, who had her reasons for not
stirring from her chair, made haste to reply:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! the means you use are very nice! I advise
you to boast of them; you ought to be ashamed of them!
a man with an education, who has clerks under him, in
an office, to raise his hand to his wife! Yes, Monsieur
Malberg, I don’t blush to confess that Monsieur Baudoin
has the baseness to strike me! that’s a nice thing to do,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>But the man to whom these questions were addressed,
observing that no one thought of giving him his light,
pushed open the door of the lodge, took his candlestick,
lighted the candle with a piece of paper, and went
upstairs without another word to the concierge and his
wife, who continued their conversation.</p>

<p>“Well, Hildegarde, do you see what you’ve done?
Here’s Monsieur Malberg had to light his candle himself!
what will he think of us?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t care what he thinks! he’s an agreeable
man, that tenant! a fellow who never talks, who hardly
answers when you speak to him, and always in a short,
surly tone, as if he was always angry!”</p>

<p>“It is true that he seldom laughs; but still perhaps
that’s his nature; there are people who enjoy being dismal.
However, he’s a man who occupies an apartment
at eleven hundred francs, and who pays on the dot, without
having to be reminded that it is rent day, and who
has very handsome furniture, and mirrors in every room,
so that the proprietor has a very high regard for him.<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t say that he’s a vagabond! but why
doesn’t he keep a maid, who’d come to our lodge in the
evening and talk, as decent people always do, instead of
that miserable blackamoor, that yellow negro, who doesn’t
know how to do anything but wax his floor and polish his
boots? as if you could call that a servant! He ought to
hire me to do his housework; that’s my line!”</p>

<p>“You forget, Hildegarde, that the landlord doesn’t
want you to do housework. Of course, if you went away
while I am at my office, there wouldn’t be anybody but
the cat to look after the lodge and answer questions!”</p>

<p>“A fine job this is, where the concierge’s wife isn’t
allowed to do housework! That was my only ambition.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! the fact is that you were the cause of our
being discharged from the lodge we had before this, because
you did housework for the men on the fourth
floor and drank all their liquor.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t true, it’s a slander!”</p>

<p>“Let’s not go back to that. I am mortified that Monsieur
Malberg had to light his candle himself; it’s a stain
upon our good name.”</p>

<p>“Well then, you ought to have lighted it for him, if
you have that on your conscience!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, Hildegarde; you’re very unreasonable
to-night, you have something bad to say about
everybody. You find fault because Monsieur Malberg
has a yellow negro to work for him, and you don’t seem
to know that that is very distinguished. Swell people
always have colored servants in their employ.<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a>”</p>

<p>“It’s a miserable fashion. But still, if that miserable
Pingo or Ponceau&mdash;I never know what his name is&mdash;was
only agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Pongo!”</p>

<p>“Oh! what a dog of a name! Pongo! But he never
talks, the blackamoor; or else he talks to himself, and
says things that I don’t understand; I believe that he
talks Morocco!”</p>

<p>“Come, Hildegarde, it’s almost twelve o’clock; go to
bed, that’s the best thing you can do.”</p>

<p>“Everybody hasn’t come in.”</p>

<p>“Yes they have, everybody except little Georget, who
lives up under the roof, with his mother.&mdash;By the way,
how is the poor woman to-day?”</p>

<p>“Not very well; she’s had more fainting fits this
afternoon, and I thought she was going <i>to put out her
gas</i>.”</p>

<p>“And her son hasn’t come home, at midnight! that’s
what I call a ne’er-do-well, a downright scamp! Hildegarde,
heaven didn’t give us any children, and I give
thanks for it in my heart; because they aren’t always
honey for parents, and often absinthe rules the roost, as
I see in the case of Mère Georget!”</p>

<p>“Absinthe&mdash;absinthe&mdash;I don’t hate that! it helps the
digestion!”</p>

<p>“Oh! bless my soul! you don’t hate any liquid; but
I know that absinthe is bad for the health; I’ve heard
some of the clerks at the office talking about two talented
actors who played at the theatre and who put an end<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>
to themselves with absinthe; without counting several
others who are in a fair way to do the same thing!”</p>

<p>“Bah! that’s all nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Come, Hildegarde, go to bed; I will come in a little
while; and if little Georget isn’t in at the quarter, I will
leave him outside; I can’t waste my oil for anyone who
never makes it up to me. Well, you don’t move; are
you fastened to your chair to-night?”</p>

<p>“Go to bed first, Baudoin; I’ll sit up for the young
man, and put the lodge in order.”</p>

<p>“You know very well that I am not in the habit of
going to bed before you. I see your scheme: you will
wait until I am asleep and then go to the cupboard to
say a word or two to the bottle!”</p>

<p>“Oh! the idea of my going to the cupboard! It’s
much more likely to be you, for you like brandy too.”</p>

<p>“I like it reasonably, like a man with some self-respect,
who doesn’t choose to make a brute of himself.&mdash;Hildegarde,
go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde, we are going to have trouble! Will you
go to bed at once?”</p>

<p>“You pester me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde, I shall be compelled to resort to severe
means. Why, you certainly are glued to your chair;
this isn’t natural, I suspect some trick. Ah! I see! I’ll
bet that the bottle isn’t in the cupboard.”</p>

<p>And Baudoin rose to go to the cupboard, but as his
wife was sitting in front of it and did not move, he<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
pushed her roughly aside, whereupon she reeled, and
almost instantly uttered a cry of distress so heartrending
that her husband feared that he had hurt her. But it
was not Hildegarde who was hurt, it was the bottle
under her skirts, which she had involuntarily upset, and
which had broken, overflowing the lodge with all the
liquor which it contained.</p>

<p>“I say! what’s all this?” cried Baudoin, when he
found a stream flowing between his feet; but soon the
odor which spread through the room left him in no doubt
as to the identity of the liquid.</p>

<p>“It is brandy; she had the bottle under her skirt;
what a vile trick!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you made me break it! that’s the worst of
it, you brute! Such splendid brandy!”</p>

<p>“Hildegarde, you persist in your debauchery; I am
going to give you a taste of the broomstick.”</p>

<p>“Touch me if you dare! I’ll call the watch! I’ll
make a disturbance in the house!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Baudoin, who was in the habit of keeping
his promises, had gone to fetch the broomstick. At that
moment, the bell at the street door rang, and this time
the woman made haste to open, hoping that it was somebody
who would protect her.</p>

<p>It was Georget, the young messenger of the flower
market, who entered the house, and in another instant
the porter’s lodge, just as Baudoin raised his broomstick
over the head of his wife, who ran behind the young
man, crying:<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a></p>

<p>“Oh! monsieur, save an unfortunate woman, whose
husband is trying to murder her!”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! how strong it smells of brandy here!”
said Georget, sniffing; then, leaping upon the broomstick
which the concierge held, he seized it with both
hands. But Baudoin held on, he would not let go, and a
struggle began between him and the young messenger,
remarkably like the battles around the flag, which we
see in the war plays at the boulevard theatres; only in
this case the flag was a broomstick and the combatants
were not in uniform.</p>

<p>The struggle continued for some time, on nearly even
terms; Baudoin was stronger and little Georget more
active. The concierge’s wife paid no heed to the contestants;
she had taken a small sponge, and was using
it to soak up the brandy from the floor; and when it was
well saturated, she put it to her lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly the broomstick broke, each of the contestants
fell backward, and the battle was at an end. Finding
himself then on a level with Madame Baudoin, who was
kneeling on the floor with her body bent forward, still
soaking and sucking her sponge, Georget could not restrain
a burst of laughter; and the concierge, who was
inclined at first to belabor his wife with what remained of
his broomstick, suddenly decided to lie down on the floor,
and to lap up the brandy with his tongue as thirsty dogs
lap up the water in the gutter.<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br /><br />
<small>THE GENTLEMAN OF THE THIRD FLOOR</small></h2>

<p>Georget left Monsieur and Madame Baudoin fighting
over the remains of the brandy with sponge and tongue,
and lighted one of the small, thin candles which are
rolled up like small rockets and which are sold for one
or two sous at the grocer’s. Then running quickly up
six flights of stairs, he reached a small door in which the
key had been left; poor people are not suspicious, especially
as they have nothing which is worth the trouble
of stealing.</p>

<p>The young messenger walked through a small room,
which received no light except through a little round
window, in which room was a cot bed supplied with a
very thin mattress and with an old window curtain which
served as bedclothes. This was Georget’s bedroom; but
he did not stop there. Opening the door at the end of
the room, and trying to make no noise, he entered another
much larger one, where there was a little window. This
room, although the walls sloped, was large enough to
contain a bed surrounded by white curtains, an old
mahogany bureau, a white wood table, a small sideboard,
several chairs, and on the mantel a tiny mirror
surrounded by a branch of consecrated boxwood. All<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
this was more than modest, but it was neat and clean;
it indicated not destitution, but poverty.</p>

<p>Georget was walking very softly, concealing his light
with his right hand, when he heard a feeble voice from
the bed:</p>

<p>“Is that you, Georget?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, it’s I. So you’re not asleep?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t been able to go to sleep, I don’t know
why.”</p>

<p>“It must be because you are sicker; and you have not
been well for several days, although you didn’t admit it
to me.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, just the lumbago, it will soon be gone.
If you would just give me something to drink, my dear,
for I am very thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, in a minute. Wait until I light your
candle and put out this tallow thing of mine which smells
worse than thirty-six lamps.”</p>

<p>After lighting a bit of candle stuck in a bottle, Georget
approached his mother’s bed.</p>

<p>“Come, now you must tell me where your medicine is.
But gracious heaven, how red your face is, mother! and
black circles round your eyes! Are you worse?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, it is the heat of the bed that does that.”</p>

<p>“Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse. Oh!
how hot your hand is! You are feverish, and very feverish
too, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, as if you knew anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes I do; you must have pain somewhere.<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>”</p>

<p>“No, I am not in pain.”</p>

<p>“The first thing in the morning I’ll fetch a doctor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to; what’s the use of a doctor, just
because one has a little fever; it will go away all right
without him!”</p>

<p>“Where is your drink?”</p>

<p>“I thought I wouldn’t make any; I prefer water, I
like it better.”</p>

<p>“Water, when one is feverish! Why, you didn’t do
right! If I did such a thing, you’d scold me and say
that I acted like a child, and you would be right. However,
tell me where the sugar is; where do you keep the
sugar, mother?”</p>

<p>“Sugar! I don’t want any; it nauseates me; I prefer
clear water.”</p>

<p>“Water without sugar, when one is as burning hot as
you are! I never heard of such a thing! You can’t
mean it! Do you want to kill yourself? I am going to
give you some sweetened water, but I must heat it; it’s
better so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no!”</p>

<p>“I say yes; I will take care of you better than you do
yourself. Come, where is the sugar? where is the coal?”</p>

<p>And Georget ran all about the room, fumbling over all
the furniture, opening all the closets, looking in every
corner, but he found nothing. Thereupon a bright light
broke upon his mind. He stopped in the middle of the
room, threw his cap on the floor, and cried in a tone of
deep distress:<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a></p>

<p>“Ah! I understand everything now! You didn’t make
yourself any drink, because you had no coal nor charcoal!
You don’t want any sugar, because you haven’t a
single particle of it here! Yes, yes, that is it! You are
out of everything! You haven’t any money either, I am
sure! and I, instead of trying to earn some, so that you
might have what you need, why, I do nothing at all!
I pass my day loafing, and at night I go to the theatre
with Patatras, who absolutely insisted on treating me.
I go about enjoying myself when my mother is sick, and
I come home without a sou, without a single piece of
money; and I haven’t anything to buy her what might
cure her! Ah! I am a wicked son, a good-for-nothing!
Forgive me, mother, forgive me; I won’t do so any
more! I will work, I swear to you that I will work
now!”</p>

<p>And the young fellow fell on his knees beside his
mother’s bed; and the poor mother forgot her suffering,
and tried only to comfort her son.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, Georget? You, a good-for-nothing!
Why, you don’t mean that, my boy! Have
I ever complained of your conduct?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know very well that you never complain; you
are too good!”</p>

<p>“You have been amusing yourself a little to-day; well,
my boy, there’s no harm in that; you must enjoy yourself
while you’re young. Your friend Chicotin took you
to the theatre; the theatre is a decent amusement; it is
much better than going to the wine shop; you don’t make<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>
evil acquaintances there, or destroy your health with unhealthy
stuff that they give you for wine. You haven’t
earned anything to-day&mdash;that is too bad, but to-morrow
you will work, and you will be happier!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow! to-morrow! but you have had nothing
to drink this evening; you haven’t any sugar; and what
will you take to quench your thirst to-night? cold water,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I am going to try to sleep; when one is asleep, one
doesn’t need to drink.”</p>

<p>“But when you wake in the morning, what shall I
give you? for you have no money here, nothing at all;
isn’t that so, mother?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, yes, my dear; for unfortunately I haven’t
been able to work for a week; my sight has been all
blurred!”</p>

<p>“Oh! you work too much, when you ought to rest.”</p>

<p>“Why so, Georget? I am not old enough yet to give
up work, I am only fifty-four! If a body was good for
nothing at that age, it would be a great pity!”</p>

<p>“I know that you’re not old, but still your health isn’t
very good, and then you didn’t use to need to work for
your living.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear, we must never say such things as that,
and sigh over the past! If one has been happy, so much
the better; if one is so no longer, so much the worse;
regrets don’t help and only make our position worse!”</p>

<p>“All this doesn’t give you any nice, hot, sweet drink,
and that is what you must have!<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>”</p>

<p>“Don’t despair, we are not altogether without resources.
You know that I have&mdash;your father’s watch;
and if it is absolutely necessary, why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say! my father’s watch, which you
think so much of! the only thing of his that you have!
part with that? No, I won’t have it. Wait&mdash;suppose I
should go and stand in front of some theatre?”</p>

<p>“What an idea! They are all over, all closed at this
time of night.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; in front of a restaurant, I may still get
something to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to go out; it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Well then, in the house; pardi! sugar and coal&mdash;people
lend each other such things as that. Don’t be impatient,
mother, I will come right back.”</p>

<p>“No, Georget, I don’t want you to ask the neighbors;
don’t, I beg you!”</p>

<p>But Georget was not listening to his mother; he had
already relighted his tallow-dip and hurried from the
room. When he reached the landing, the young man
stopped, for he was uncertain to whom he should apply
for the loan which he wished to obtain; but he did not
hesitate long. He ran down the stairs three or four at
a time, and did not stop until he reached the ground floor
and knocked at the concierge’s lodge, saying to himself:</p>

<p>“Baudoin and his wife are not unkind; they dispute
together, and fight sometimes, but they haven’t bad
hearts; they won’t refuse me. Besides, it is only a loan,
I will return it all.<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>”</p>

<p>But Georget forgot that he had left the concierge and
his wife engaged in an occupation which was likely to
plunge them into a profound slumber ere long. In fact,
after sucking and lapping brandy for some time, the
husband and wife had felt such an intense longing to
sleep, that they had hardly strength enough to reach
their bed; and as the sleep caused by intoxication is
never light, Monsieur and Madame Baudoin did not hear
the knocking at their door; one might have fired a cannon
under their noses, and they would simply have said:
“God bless you!”</p>

<p>Weary of knocking to no purpose, Georget walked
away from the lodge, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Those concierges are regular beer kegs; I shall never
succeed in waking them, and I might as well give it up.
Let me see, where can I apply? on the first floor? The
whole floor is occupied by a family of English people, who
hardly understand what you say to them and who don’t
look very pleasant; I should not be well received there,
they would not be able to understand what I said. On
the second floor is a very pretty, very stylish lady, who
receives fine gentlemen, but who refuses to open her
door when she has company; her maid told me so the
other day,&mdash;those are her orders. On the third,&mdash;ah!
that is the gentleman that they call the <i>Bear</i> in the house,
because he never talks with anybody, never receives any
visitors, and hardly answers when you speak to him.
Much use there would be in trying to borrow sugar and
charcoal of that man! and still, if I thought that his black<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
man would open the door;&mdash;but no, Pongo sleeps so
sound that he never hears his master come home. So it
would be the gentleman himself who would open the door,
and he would shut it in my face without answering me. I
don’t even dare to try!&mdash;On the fourth, on one side is
an old woman, so timid that she will never open her
door after dusk; on the other, a student; but he has
gone into the country. And at the top, opposite us, no
one; the room is to let. Mon Dieu! whom shall I apply
to then, if among all these people I can see no hope of
help for my poor mother, who has a high fever and no
cooling draft to lessen her suffering? Ah! Chicotin was
quite right to say that I am a fool to be in love, that I
am too young. Mamzelle Violette makes me forget my
mother, my duty, my work. To think that I have done
nothing to-day! that I came home without a sou when I
knew that my mother was sick! Oh, I am a miserable,
heartless villain! I shall never forgive myself!”</p>

<p>As he said this, Georget went slowly upstairs, stopping
frequently because he was weeping; and he had stopped
again, and rested his head against the wall, to sob at his
ease, when a door opened within two steps of him.</p>

<p>He was then on the landing of the third floor, and it
was Monsieur Malberg who stood before him. When he
saw the young messenger, who still had the look of a
mere boy, beating his head against the wall, and giving
free vent to his sobs, the gentleman who was called the
Bear, and who in fact had a rather stern expression and
a rather rough voice, walked toward Georget and asked:<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a></p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Well! monsieur, you see, I am crying, I am unhappy.”</p>

<p>“And why are you crying?”</p>

<p>“Because my mother is sick, and because she has
nothing that might help her; because I didn’t work to-day,
and came home to the house without a sou; because
I am a heartless wretch, and I deserve to be beaten!”</p>

<p>“Well, do you think that if you beat your head against
the wall that that will help your mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, monsieur! but when a fellow doesn’t know
which way to turn! I went down and knocked at the
concierge’s door; I wanted to borrow a little sugar and
some charcoal of them; but they didn’t answer; I suppose
they sleep too sound!”</p>

<p>“So you live in the house, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, at the top, under the eaves; I live
there with my mother, who is the widow of my father,
Pierre Brunoy, who was a soldier, a non-commissioned
officer, who left the service on account of a wound. Oh!
he was a fine man, was my father! He was a draughts-man,
he had lots of talent, and he used to make designs
for ladies who embroider; we were happy then; but he
died. My mother undertook to keep a little smallwares
shop, to earn enough to educate me; but she didn’t succeed,
for no one paid her. Then, as she works very well
on linen, she began to work for people, and I, knowing
that I ought to help mother, whose health isn’t very good,
and who has weak eyes, I said to myself: ‘I will be a<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>
messenger, for I could never find a place, although I can
read and write and figure; or else I should have to work
without pay for a long while and I must earn money
right away to help mother.’&mdash;So I started in as a messenger;
for there isn’t any foolish trade, so I was told;&mdash;and&mdash;that’s all, monsieur.”</p>

<p>The gentleman of the third floor listened attentively
to Georget, and when he had finished, said to him:</p>

<p>“Come with me.”</p>

<p>“Where, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Into my room, of course.”</p>

<p>“What for, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“You will see; come.”</p>

<p>The youth placed his tallow-dip on the floor, and
followed the gentleman; his heart was still heavy, for
he didn’t understand how the person who occupied the
handsome apartment on the third floor could need his
services so late. Monsieur Malberg passed through a
reception room very carefully polished, and into a beautiful
dining-room. There he stopped, opened a large
sideboard, took out a loaf of sugar, which was hardly
touched, and placed it in Georget’s hand, saying:</p>

<p>“Take this!”</p>

<p>The poor boy looked at him with an almost dazed expression,
and murmured:</p>

<p>“What is this, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that it is sugar?”</p>

<p>“Sugar, oh, yes! but this great loaf,&mdash;who’s all this
for?<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>”</p>

<p>“For your mother, of course! Didn’t you tell me that
she hadn’t any and that she was sick?”</p>

<p>“Oh! is it possible, monsieur, that you are so kind as&mdash;but
this is too much, monsieur, too much.”</p>

<p>“Hush, and come with me.”</p>

<p>This time Monsieur Malberg went into his kitchen,
where Georget followed him, holding the loaf of sugar
in his arms. The gentleman pointed to a large box without
a cover, which stood under the stove, saying:</p>

<p>“Take that box; there’s charcoal in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how kind you are, monsieur! How can I thank
you for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It isn’t worth while, I don’t like thanks; take this
box, I say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, but be sure&mdash;I will return all this;
pray believe me. Oh! I will work to pay my debt.”</p>

<p>“Very well, very well! By the way, wait; I have
some linden leaves here, and some mallow; perhaps they
will be good for your mother, and you haven’t any in
your room, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give you some then; come.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Malberg returned to his dining-room. Georget
still followed him, holding under one arm the loaf
of sugar, and under the other the box filled with charcoal.
The gentleman opened the drawer of a small piece of
furniture, took out several paper bags, looked to see
what they contained, put two of them aside, and was
about to give them to Georget, when he stopped as if a<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>
sudden thought had struck him, and left the dining-room,
saying:</p>

<p>“I will return in a moment; what I want isn’t there;
wait here.”</p>

<p>The young messenger was careful not to stir; he was
so pleased that he wondered whether he was not the play-thing
of a dream; but he for whom he was waiting soon
returned, bringing several small packages of herbs, saying:</p>

<p>“Here are some things which may be good for your
mother,&mdash;linden, orange leaves, mallow and violet; take
them all, or rather let me put them in your pocket, for
you have no hand free.”</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur! excuse me for the trouble I put you
to. Mon Dieu! you are too kind! I will pay you for
this, monsieur; for we are not beggars, we don’t ask alms,
and I should be sorry for you to have that idea of us.”</p>

<p>“Very good! Your mother is sick and may need you;
don’t leave her alone any longer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, you are right; my poor mother, she
will be so happy, so&mdash;so&mdash;Thanks, monsieur, oh, thanks
a thousand times! Remember that I am always here
day and night, at your service.”</p>

<p>“I will remember; but go.”</p>

<p>And the gentleman pushed Georget before him, so that
he soon found himself on the landing once more. The
door of the apartment closed, and he reascended the staircase
as quickly as he could, with his box of charcoal, his
loaf of sugar, and his tallow-dip still lighted.<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a></p>

<p>At last he reached his room; this time he was not
afraid of making a noise when he went in; he was too
happy not to wish to tell his mother about it; but she
was not asleep, and she gazed in amazement at her son
when he danced into the room, and placed the loaf of
sugar on her bed, crying:</p>

<p>“There, mother; you shall not drink plain cold water
any more! Here is sugar, here is charcoal, and in my
pocket I have half a dozen herbs in leaves. Ah! what
luck! you will be cured right away! I can nurse you
nicely now.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean, my dear? where did you get
all these things? You hadn’t a sou just now. Explain
yourself, Georget, I insist.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, yes, never fear, I am going to tell you the
whole story; but let me light the stove first, and then,
while I blow my charcoal, I will tell you how Providence
came to our assistance. Where is the stove? Ah! there
it is. This will light very quickly, I know, although the
bellows isn’t any too good.”</p>

<p>“Did you get all these things in the house, my son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother; you see, first of all, I went down to
borrow from the concierge, Monsieur Baudoin; but it
wasn’t any use for me to knock at their door, I couldn’t
wake them, they’re worse than deaf people. So then I
was coming up again in very low spirits, indeed, I believe
I was crying, when the door on the third landing
opened, and the gentleman who lives there came out to
me. Oh! this thing proves, mother, that people very<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>
often say foolish things, or that it’s very wrong to judge
a person by his appearance. For that gentleman that
they call the Bear, that gentleman that never speaks to
anybody, and that everybody makes stupid jokes about,
why, he took me into his room, and gave me all these
things for you, because I told him that you were sick;
and he didn’t even let me thank him!&mdash;Ah! you miserable
charcoal! you’ve got to burn! Now I am going to
put some water over the fire.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, this is an enormous loaf of sugar, and
it is almost whole; you ought not to have borrowed so
much as this.”</p>

<p>“As if that gentleman would listen to me! He says:
‘Take this!’ and if you try to remonstrate, he shouts:
‘Hold your tongue!’ and it’s impossible to prevent him
from doing what he wants to.&mdash;Ah! my fire is going at
last!”</p>

<p>“But this Monsieur Malberg&mdash;for the gentleman of the
third floor is named Malberg&mdash;I have never met him;
what sort of looking man is he, Georget? You must
have had a good look at him, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! mother; why, he’s a man neither young
nor old. At first sight, I am sure that you would take
him to be older than he really is, because when a person
never laughs, that makes him look older. He may be
somewhat over fifty years old; his face is not ugly, not
by any means, but his features have a sort of stern expression;
his eyes are always gloomy and melancholy,
and there are great wrinkles on his brow; his eyebrows<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>
are heavy, and his hair must have been black, but it’s a
little gray now. When he fixes his great brown eyes on
you, it frightens you; and yet I got used to them, for
his expression is neither unkind nor contemptuous; it’s&mdash;I
don’t know just how to describe it&mdash;it’s sort of compassionate,
or sorrowful; and his voice, which sounds
harsh at first, is much less so when he’s talked to you
for some time. You see, mother, that gentleman isn’t
like most people; oh, no! he makes you respect him,
and it comes natural to obey him, and you don’t dare to
say anything.”</p>

<p>“Really, my dear, you make me long to know this
gentleman; when I am able to go out, I shall go to
thank him. And did you tell him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just how we are placed, what we used to be, and
what father did. Yes, I told him everything. Did I do
wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, my boy, we have done nothing which we need to
be ashamed of or to conceal.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my water is boiling; now I am going to make
you some herb tea, mother; which would you rather
have?”</p>

<p>“Why, tell me first what you have in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Wait and I’ll show you; I have a whole lot of
bundles! Here, see what this is.”</p>

<p>“Violet.”</p>

<p>“And this?”</p>

<p>“Linden leaves.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and&mdash;well! here’s something else now!<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Georget? Have you lost something?”</p>

<p>“Lost! oh, no! not by any means, mother! What
I have just found in my pocket certainly wasn’t there
before! I am sure of that.”</p>

<p>“Why, what have you found in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“Here, look, mother!”</p>

<p>And the young messenger tossed upon the good
woman’s bed four five-franc pieces.</p>

<p>“Twenty francs, Georget! twenty francs! What does
this mean? where did you get all that money, my son?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea, mother; and I am very sure that
I didn’t have it when I came home. I didn’t have a sou.”</p>

<p>“But this money didn’t get into your pocket of itself.
Answer me, Georget, and above all, don’t lie.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! how you say that, mother! Do you suppose
that I am capable of having stolen this money from
someone, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I do not suppose that my son, that the
child of my honest Brunoy, would ever do a wicked
action; but I have always carefully preserved your
father’s watch, and some time, without my knowledge,
to help me, you might have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pawned papa’s watch! Oh! never! I’d rather pawn
myself! but wait, mother; I remember now; yes, that
must have been it.”</p>

<p>“What? tell me.”</p>

<p>“That gentleman on the third floor, when I had the
loaf of sugar and the box of charcoal in my arms, insisted<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>
on putting all these little bundles of dried leaves in my
pocket himself; and that’s the way he stuffed these five-franc
pieces into my pocket! Oh! I am sure of it now!
for he went into his bedroom alone, to get the money, no
doubt. It was him, mother, it was him; indeed, who
else could have given me all this?”</p>

<p>“You are right, Georget, it can’t have been anybody
else; people who like to do good, think of everything,
and it seems that he is very kind, this Bear!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, he is kind, but I shall not keep his
money. I will work to-morrow, and earn some; and he
has put us under enough obligation by lending us sugar
and charcoal. Mother, we mustn’t keep these twenty
francs that he slipped into my pocket so slyly, so that I
could not thank him, must we? But still, it was very nice
of him, all the same; he isn’t like other people, that
gentleman! I’ll bet that when he tosses a piece of money
to a poor man, he doesn’t try to make it ring on the sidewalk
when it falls.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, we mustn’t keep the twenty francs, for
it is quite a large sum, and it would be too hard to repay
it.”</p>

<p>“I am going to take it back to the gentleman right
away.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it must be quite late now; Monsieur Malberg
has gone to bed, no doubt, and is probably asleep; if
you wake him up, he won’t like it. Wait till morning,
and when he’s up, you can take the money back to him,
and thank him again for both of us.<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>”</p>

<p>“After all, you are right, mother; it will be better
for me to let the gentleman sleep, who has helped me to
cure you. I will go to-morrow morning, when his negro
is up.&mdash;But the water is still boiling; give me what I
need for your tea.”</p>

<p>The invalid chose one of the herbs. Georget soon made
the tea and carried his mother a cup smoking hot and
well sweetened; and when she had drunk it, he filled the
cup again and placed it on the table by the bed.</p>

<p>“If you are thirsty again in the night,” he said, “you
must drink this; it will be all ready; now try to go to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, but it seems to me that I feel better
already.”</p>

<p>“Well! mother; it is always like that; when a person
has all that he needs to get well, then the disease must
go.”</p>

<p>“Oh! not always, my boy, for in that case rich people
would never be sick; but the thing that relieves one is
contentment, happiness. It requires so little to make poor
people happy! and what has happened to us this evening
is real good fortune.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! it is a kind of good fortune that the rich
do not know, but that they can confer on others; and
that must be a great pleasure too.&mdash;Good-night, mother;
if you need anything, call me.<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br /><br />
<small>A DIFFICULT ERRAND</small></h2>

<p>The next day, before six o’clock, Georget was up and
dressed; he went first to inquire concerning his mother’s
health; the invalid had slept, and felt better, although
she was still too weak to rise. She smiled as she said:</p>

<p>“Up already, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I must earn a lot of money to-day, mother, in order
to bring you all that you need.”</p>

<p>“But I need nothing, as I have the material for making
herb tea.”</p>

<p>“Oh! nobody knows! if you get better, perhaps a
little beef soup won’t be a bad thing for you. When a
fellow is out on the boulevard early, he is more apt to find
work. There are maids who have bundles to send,
people who have to go into the country and are looking
for a cab&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Poor Georget! what a miserable trade yours is!
Knowing how to write and figure as you do, you ought
to have found a place in some office, or a clerkship in
some shop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! and wait a year or two before earning any
kind of a salary! Don’t think about that any more,
mother; I am very happy as I am! A clerk! shut up<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>
all day in an office! oh! how sick I should get of that!
then I should never see her!”</p>

<p>“Who is it that you’d never see, my child?”</p>

<p>Georget blushed, but made haste to reply:</p>

<p>“I mean that I shouldn’t see you during the day,
whenever I wanted to. By the way, mother, I must go
to see the gentleman on the third floor, the gentleman
who is so kind, although he doesn’t show it. I am going
to return his twenty francs.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a little too early? He isn’t up yet, probably.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am very sure that he gets up early; he isn’t one
of the kind to coddle himself. Anyway, I’ll ask his valet,
that mulatto who’s such a strange creature, they say.”</p>

<p>“Go, my dear, and thank the gentleman from me, until
I can do it myself.”</p>

<p>Georget cast a glance at the mirror to make sure that
nothing was lacking in his costume. When a man is in
love, he becomes particular about his looks, and Georget
would have been very glad to please the pretty flower
girl of the Château d’Eau, who seemed to look upon him
as a child; that distressed the poor boy, he was sorry
that he was not at least twenty years old, because he
thought that then she would pay more attention to him.
For we are never content with the passage of time; when
we are young, we think that it doesn’t move fast enough;
later, we complain because it moves too fast. And yet
we know that the wisest course is to take it as it comes;
probably we are not often wise, as we are always growling
about it.<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a></p>

<p>Georget went down to the third floor, and rang softly
at Monsieur Malberg’s door; a very dark mulatto, whose
hair age had not yet turned white, and who spoke French
very well for a colored man, and very ill for a Parisian,
opened the door and recognized the young messenger
whom he had met sometimes on the stairs.</p>

<p>“Hullo! it’s Monsieur Georget. Morning, Monsieur
Georget! What you come here for so early?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Pongo, I would like to speak to your
master, Monsieur Malberg.”</p>

<p>“Oh! master not up yet, he still sleep; I get up
sooner, to tidy the room, rub floor here in the morning
without waking master.”</p>

<p>“If he is still asleep, I will wait.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you sit down on a nice little chair, like this.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Monsieur Pongo; I hope I am not in your
way; go on with your work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, then I go very soft and see if monsieur still
sleep.”</p>

<p>The mulatto went into another room. Georget sat
down and waited. After a few moments he heard voices
in the next room and supposed that Monsieur Malberg
was awake. But still he was left alone, nobody came,
and Georget, beginning to be impatient, coughed, walked
about the room and stole softly to the door, which was
ajar. He was surprised to find that the mulatto was
alone, but that as he did his work, he kept up a steady
conversation with all the furniture and other objects in
the study, which to him were people to whom he gave<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>
names, according to the custom of the people of his
country.</p>

<p>“You stay there, Broubrou!” said Pongo to a tall
Voltaire easy-chair. “You all right, you satisfied, all
brushed, all cleaned, all ready for master to use, unless
he take Babo, the little horsehair chair. Oh! Babo, you’d
be mighty pleased if master took you instead of Madame
Broubrou! she take up much more room.&mdash;There! now
you all cleaned, well rubbed, good ‘nough to eat.&mdash;But I
forget Zima; where you hide yourself, Zima? oh! no
good for you to hide yourself, I know all right how to
find you.”</p>

<p>And the mulatto looked in every corner of the room,
and at last succeeded in finding a small bamboo cane with
a gilt head. It was that cane to which Pongo had given
the name of Zima. He took it up and shook it impatiently,
muttering:</p>

<p>“Ah! Mamzelle Zima, you try to make fun of Pongo
and keep out of sight a long time. Suppose me cross and
not rub you head to make you shine, how you like that,
eh, Mamzelle Zima?”</p>

<p>At this point, the scene between the mulatto and the
cane was interrupted by shouts of laughter. They came
from Georget, who, not being used to the customs of
Africa, had been unable to restrain longer the desire to
laugh, caused by the faithful Pongo’s monologue. He
turned when he heard the laughter, and seeing the youth,
began to laugh too, and, cane in hand, to take several
steps of a strange dance which recalled the famous dance<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>
of the <i>Cocos,</i> performed in all the melodramas in which
negroes are introduced.</p>

<p>A ring at the bell interrupted this extemporaneous
ballet; Pongo dropped Mademoiselle Zima, and left the
study, saying:</p>

<p>“That’s master, he ring for me; he awake, I go tell
him that you waiting.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the mulatto returned, and ushered
Georget into Monsieur Malberg’s bedroom; that gentleman
was enveloped in an ample dressing-gown and held
a newspaper, which he seemed to be reading.</p>

<p>He glanced at Georget, who remained bashfully in the
doorway of the room, twisting his cap about in his
hands.</p>

<p>“It’s you, is it, young man? What do you want of me
so early in the morning? Is your mother sicker?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! thanks to heaven and to you, monsieur!
But I have come because I found this twenty francs in
the pocket in which monsieur was kind enough to put
some herbs for me to make my mother some tea. It
was another kindness on monsieur’s part, no doubt, but
he is too kind; we must not keep this money, for it
would take us too long to return it; and so I have
brought the twenty francs back.”</p>

<p>The gentleman in the dressing-gown resumed the
perusal of his newspaper, as he answered in a crabbed
tone:</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean; the money is yours, if
it was in your pocket; keep it and let me alone.<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, I am very sure that that twenty
francs isn’t mine, as I didn’t own a sou to buy sugar,
and that was why I was crying on the landing.”</p>

<p>“Well! what then? how does that concern me?”</p>

<p>“Why, monsieur, as nobody else but you put anything
in my pocket, it must have been you who put these five-franc
pieces there.”</p>

<p>“You are dreaming!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t I!”</p>

<p>“I am sure that it was!”</p>

<p>“Corbleu! you tire me! Well, suppose it was? If
I chose to put those five-franc pieces in your pocket, am
I not at liberty to put my money where I choose? Do
you propose to prevent me from helping you, when I
have too much money, and know that you haven’t enough?
You are very proud, it seems, master messenger?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it isn’t that, monsieur; but you have already
overwhelmed us with your kindness; it would be wrong
to show our appreciation of it by accepting what we
don’t need.”</p>

<p>“You lie! you do need money, for last night you were
without a sou, and I don’t suppose that you have earned
any during the night.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, my mother has all she needs now,
and I am going to earn some money to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oho! you are very confident, aren’t you? How do
you know that you will find work to-day, that it will be a
good day for you?<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a>”</p>

<p>“Why! monsieur, it very seldom happens that a whole
day passes without someone employing us; a man would
have to be very unlucky to have that happen.”</p>

<p>“And you think that you are in no danger of such
bad luck? Well, tell me how you expect to earn money
for your mother?”</p>

<p>“By doing errands, monsieur, as that is my business.”</p>

<p>“And how much do you get for an errand usually?”</p>

<p>“Why, that depends, monsieur, on how far I have to
go; and then some people are more generous than others.”</p>

<p>“But about how much?”</p>

<p>“Twelve sous, fifteen sous, sometimes twenty sous;
but that’s not often, unless we carry bundles.”</p>

<p>“And you take without a murmur whatever anyone
chooses to give you?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, monsieur, as it’s the pay for our work.”</p>

<p>“Well, Monsieur Georget, I take you for my messenger
from to-day; and it’s my pleasure to pay you two
francs for every errand that you do for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is too much, monsieur; no one ever pays
as much as that.”</p>

<p>“If it suits me to pay that price, do you propose to
prevent me from being more generous than other people?&mdash;You understand then, the twenty francs that you have
received is a payment in advance on account of the errands
you may do for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur; then it’s for ten errands.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, for ten errands.”</p>

<p>“But there’s the sugar too.<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>”</p>

<p>“Confound it! now it’s the sugar! well, call it one
errand more.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is mistaken; it was at least nine pounds
of sugar, and that makes&mdash;that makes&mdash;I don’t know just
the price of sugar.”</p>

<p>“Nor I; say no more about it, and don’t bother me
with all these trifles!”</p>

<p>“And the charcoal, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“This little fellow has evidently made a vow to drive
me mad! Call it as many errands as you choose, and let
me alone.”</p>

<p>“I will call it fifteen, monsieur, but I am very sorry
that I have offended monsieur, who is so very kind, and
I will go, monsieur, I will go!”</p>

<p>And Georget had already reached the door, when Monsieur
Malberg called him back.</p>

<p>“Listen, my boy, as you seem in such a hurry to pay
your debt to me, I will employ you at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh! so much the better, monsieur, so much the
better!”</p>

<p>“Listen: there is somewhere or other in the world a
person whom I lost sight of almost&mdash;almost nineteen
years ago, and whom I am very desirous to find. At
that time, the gentleman in question, for it is a gentleman
that I am talking about, was some thirty-three or thirty-four
years of age; he was tall, with a good figure, and
was rather a handsome man. Moreover, he was a dandy,
a man of fashion, and always dressed with much elegance;
but as that was nineteen years ago, his appearance may<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>
have changed greatly! However, the man’s name is
Monsieur de Roncherolle.”</p>

<p>“Very good, monsieur; and where did this handsome
Monsieur de&mdash;de&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Roncherolle.”</p>

<p>“Roncherolle live? Oh! I shall not forget the name
again.”</p>

<p>“He lived&mdash;but what good will it do you to know
where he lived then, as at that time he suddenly left his
lodgings in Paris, and left France, I imagine?”</p>

<p>“Still, he might have returned to his lodgings since.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that I haven’t been there a hundred
times to inquire? No, he has never come back to the
place where he used to live; but he did come back to
Paris ten years ago, I am certain of that; but I was
travelling then, and we never met. When I returned, he
had gone away again; but, if I can believe certain reports,
certain indications, he returned to Paris some time
ago, and is living&mdash;in what quarter of the city? I have
no idea. You see that the errand that I give you is a
difficult one. For a very long time, I, myself, have been
looking for that gentleman, but have failed to find him.
If you succeed in discovering him, why, then I shall
look upon myself as your debtor, and shall find a way
to prove my gratitude to you!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is jesting! he forgets that he has already
paid me in advance for fifteen errands. But if only this
Monsieur de Roncherolle has not changed his name&mdash;for
in that case it would be very difficult to find him!<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>”</p>

<p>“He will not have changed his name, for he belongs
to an old family, and was very proud of it.”</p>

<p>“Did he do anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing except use up his fortune as slowly as possible;
and in all this time he must have gone to the end
of it. However, he has probably retained his youthful
habits: it is in the Chaussée d’Antin quarter, at the close
of the Opéra, or of the Théâtre des Italiens, or in front
of the best restaurants in Paris, that you are likely to
find him, that chance may lead to his being called by
name in your presence; for you do not know him, my
poor boy, you have no description of him, and I can
supply you with no other means of identifying him. So
I fancy that I am giving you a commission impossible to
execute!”</p>

<p>“Why so, monsieur? We hear so many things, we
messengers! We go about in all sorts of places; we see
the whole of Paris, and I will bet that I discover him,
and in that case I will come instantly and report what I
have learned.”</p>

<p>“That goes without saying.”</p>

<p>“But this commission will not prevent monsieur from
giving me others; and if he has any letters to deliver&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; very well; now go.”</p>

<p>Georget left the bedroom; in the reception room he
found Pongo in a serious dispute with Mademoiselle
Zima, who had fallen twice to the floor and refused to
rise without assistance. But Georget had no time to stop;
he was in too great a hurry to tell his mother of his<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>
interview with the gentleman on the third floor. He lost
no time in doing so, as soon as he was with the excellent
woman; and he tossed the four five-franc pieces on the
bed, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“They are really ours now, for that gentleman absolutely
insisted on paying me in advance. So we are
rich! You shall have everything you want; besides, I
am going to earn money too. Good-by, mother; stay in
bed, and take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Why, Georget, you go off in such a hurry; you must
take one of these pieces at least; for you must live too.”</p>

<p>“No, mother, I don’t mean to touch that money; I
mean to earn some first of all, and not eat my breakfast
until I have worked.”</p>

<p>“Georget, that’s nonsense! Will you listen to me?”</p>

<p>But the young messenger was not listening; he was
already at the foot of the stairs, and in front of the concierge’s
lodge, where he found Madame Baudoin, alone,
still gazing with an air of deep affliction at the marks of
the brandy on the floor.</p>

<p>Georget’s first thought was to go to the Boulevard du
Château d’Eau, where he was very certain to find
Violette, for the flower girl was always there, even
when it was not a market day. That was the advantage
of her branch of business; hand bouquets are of
all times, and there are some flowers in all seasons;
which is very fortunate for lovers, who give them all
the year around, and for the ladies, who would like to
receive them all their lives.<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a></p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br /><br />
<small>THE BLUE PHIAL</small></h2>

<p>Violette was seated behind her counter, making bouquets;
she had a peculiar knack at blending colors, and
giving its full effect to the simplest flower; her bouquets
were tasteful, even when they were made up of modest
flowers only; there was taste and charm in their arrangement;
her art was apparent in every one. There are
people who spoil whatever they touch, and others who
can make something out of nothing.</p>

<p>Georget stopped a few feet away from the flower girl,
and looked at her; but she was so busy over her bouquets
that she did not see him, or at least did not seem
to see him; so he decided to accost her.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mamzelle Violette.”</p>

<p>“Ah! is it you, Monsieur Georget?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me; I have been here some time already,
within a few feet of you, looking at you; but you didn’t
deign to glance in my direction.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t deign! what does that mean? Do you think
that I wouldn’t have said good-morning to you if I had
seen you? Do you accuse me of being impolite now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! that isn’t what I mean, mamzelle; but sometimes,
when one doesn’t care to talk with a person&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a>”</p>

<p>“Are you going to begin that again, Georget? If I
didn’t want to talk with you, what compels me to? I
believe that I am my own mistress&mdash;alas! only too much
my own mistress, as I don’t know my parents, and my
last protectress, Mère Gazon, is lying yonder in the
cemetery.”</p>

<p>“Well, now you are sad! I tell you, Mamzelle Violette,
I was terribly sad last night too, for my mother was
sick, and we were short of money.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me so, Georget? I would have
lent you money. You know very well that I have some,
that I sell as much as I want to sell, and that it wouldn’t
have troubled me at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh! upon my word! Borrow money of you, of you,
mademoiselle! never!”</p>

<p>“What! never? what does this mean? Why not of
me as well as of anybody else? Don’t you look upon me
as your friend, or do you think me a hard-hearted creature,
who would not take pleasure in obliging you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no! it isn’t that! on the contrary I know
very well that you are kind-hearted, that you love to do
good; I have often seen you give money to unfortunate
people! But it isn’t that; it is&mdash;mon Dieu! I don’t know
how to express it; it is that I should be ashamed, I should
blush to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, well! you are getting all mixed up. I go
straight to the point: Georget, do you want money? I
have some here,&mdash;fifteen francs, twenty-five francs; it
won’t embarrass me in the least.<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>”</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks, mamzelle; I am very grateful; but
now it isn’t as it was last night; our position has changed,
and we are in funds.”</p>

<p>“Is that really true? how does it happen that in so
short a time&mdash;Georget, if you are deceiving me, it is very
wrong; you have no money!”</p>

<p>To prove to the flower girl that he was not deceiving
her, the messenger told her all that had happened since
the evening before. Violette listened with the deepest
interest, and her eyes filled with tears at the story of
Monsieur Malberg’s kindness.</p>

<p>“Ah! that gentleman is a fine man!” cried the girl,
almost leaping from her chair. “Suppose I should carry
him a bouquet from you; would that please him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! On the contrary it would make him angry;
he doesn’t like to be thanked; I am sure that he would
be angry with me, if he knew that I had told you how
kind he was.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pity; I would like to know him. Does he
ever walk in this direction on market day?”</p>

<p>“No, I have never seen him here. He’s a man who
doesn’t like society, nor noise; and when you don’t know
him, why, he hasn’t an agreeable manner, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“But when one knows that he is kind and generous,
then one ought not to be frightened by his manner.”</p>

<p>“No matter, I assure you, mamzelle, that in his presence
no one dares to laugh.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of laughing, Monsieur Georget, I am going
to scold you now.<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>”</p>

<p>“Scold me?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed. Oh! it’s of no use for you to assume
your innocent air, I was not fooled by what happened
yesterday afternoon. The idea of throwing my customers
down! that’s very pretty, isn’t it? If you should do that
often, I don’t think that I should sell so many bouquets.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t throw anybody down!”</p>

<p>“No, not you, but that good-for-nothing Chicotin,
who had planned the thing beforehand with you, because
he knew that it would please you. Am I right? Come,
Georget, answer me&mdash;didn’t you plan with Chicotin to
throw that gentleman down?”</p>

<p>“Not that one, mamzelle, I haven’t any grudge against
that one; it was the other one; Chicotin made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“One or the other, it was very wrong, monsieur, to
run against my customers and overturn almost the whole
of my shop.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you that Chicotin made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you that if either you or he ever do that
sort of thing again, that will be the end, and I will not
speak to you any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh! never fear, mademoiselle, we shan’t do it again;
not I, that is, for I can’t answer for others.”</p>

<p>“The others only do what you want.”</p>

<p>“Not speak to you any more? would that be possible?
In the first place, I should keep on speaking to you!”</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t answer you.”</p>

<p>“Then you would mean to kill me with grief?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, people don’t die for that sort of thing!<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think so, because you don’t feel what I do,
here in the bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p>“Georget, I thought that you intended to work hard
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Ah! so I do, you are right.&mdash;By the way, mamzelle,
you don’t happen to know a gentleman named De Roncherolle,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“True, this isn’t the quarter where I can expect to find
him; I must go to Boulevard des Italiens, to the Chaussée
d’Antin; that’s a pity, for it’s a long way from you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you don’t expect to do errands
except in the neighborhood of the Château d’Eau?”</p>

<p>“Why! of course I know that that isn’t possible; but
I hate so to go away from you.”</p>

<p>“Really, Georget, you make me want to laugh; you
are not old enough yet to be in love, it isn’t so very long
since I used to see you playing marbles with urchins of
your age!”</p>

<p>“Oh! upon my word! it’s a long, long time since I
stopped playing marbles; why, that’s a game for
children.”</p>

<p>“Oh! mon Dieu! don’t defend yourself so eagerly;
there’s no harm in it. And let me tell you, Georget, you
would do better to play now than to pass your time sighing
and looking up at the sky, and always having a dismal
expression; you are better looking when you laugh.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so, mamzelle? Well! it isn’t my fault,
it isn’t by preference that I am dismal sometimes; but<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>
you always treat me like a child, and that annoys me.
However, I am seventeen and a half, and I believe that
I am almost as old as you.”</p>

<p>“No, I am more than eighteen; and at that age, a
girl is much older than a boy and ought to have more
common sense.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s all nonsense! on the contrary, there are
men of seventeen who are already soldiers, and who have
been in the army. Why, there’s a little drummer, who
was lately stationed at the barracks in Faubourg du
Temple, who was not more than eighteen years old, and
he had been to Africa, where he passed three years, and
was in battles with the Arabs.”</p>

<p>“Does that tempt you? Are you inclined to go as a
drummer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say that; still, if I didn’t have my mother,
and if there wasn’t any hope of my being loved by the
person I love, why, then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come, come! go and do your errand, Georget; you
forget that that gentleman paid you in advance!”</p>

<p>“You are right, mamzelle; I stand here talking, and
the time passes so quickly when I am talking with you!
But I mean that you shall be satisfied with me; I won’t
be sad any more, and I won’t loaf any more.”</p>

<p>“We shall see!”</p>

<p>“Then will you have a little affection for me?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I already? do you doubt it? Yes, I have
affection for you, because I know that you are not a
ne’er-do-well, a good-for-nothing, like so many others of<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>
your age, and because you are so fond of your mother,
whose only support you are. Ah! how lucky you are
to have your mother, Georget, and to be able to work
for her! If I only knew mine, I would take such pleasure
in giving her the fruit of my work, in kissing her and
coddling her and taking every care of her! Oh, yes!
I would have loved my mother dearly! but I never had
one, or rather she is dead; or else&mdash;she deserted me!”</p>

<p>“There, now it is you who are sad! don’t think about
all that any more, mamzelle; they say that children without
parents, and without a name, are the ones who always
make their fortune.”</p>

<p>“Why! that is easily understood, because then the
good Lord takes the place of their family, He never loses
sight of them, and gives them good inspirations; and
with a protector like Him, they can never fail to make
their way.&mdash;But you must go, Georget!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamzelle. Ah! I am happy this morning! my
heart is full of joy; I have talked with you, and I shall
have a good day.”</p>

<p>“Good! now you are in good spirits, and that is the
way I love to see you, the way I would like you to be
always, because&mdash;Well, it is changing already! your
brow is clouded and you turn pale;&mdash;what is the matter,
Georget? Don’t you feel well?”</p>

<p>The young messenger had, in fact, changed color, and
his smiling face, his eyes beaming with happiness, had
suddenly assumed a different expression. A single glance
in the distance had sufficed to cause this revolution:<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>
Georget had caught sight of Monsieur Jéricourt, the
handsome man who was in love with the flower girl,
walking very slowly in front of the Château d’Eau, not
like a person who was going elsewhere, but like one who
had come there with a purpose.</p>

<p>Violette followed the direction of Georget’s eyes, and
speedily discovered the cause of his change of countenance;
thereupon she shrugged her shoulders impatiently
and cried:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! is it going to begin again?&mdash;You are
going to do your errand, I hope, Georget?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamzelle, yes, I’m going, I’m going right away;
for if I didn’t, I might do more foolish things. Here
comes that perfumed dandy who makes love to you&mdash;here
he comes again; it seems that he means to come every
day now; it’s a regular thing!”</p>

<p>“That gentleman is perfectly free to walk on the
boulevard; what makes you think it’s on my account?”</p>

<p>“What makes me think so? why, it’s plain enough;
you know as well as I do that it’s on your account. Oh!
what a pity that the boulevard’s free to everybody!&mdash;I’m
going, mamzelle, I’m going!”</p>

<p>Georget made up his mind to go, at last; he passed
Jéricourt, upon whom he bestowed a savage glance; but
that gentleman did not notice him.</p>

<p>On the previous day the young author had been flatly
snubbed by the flower girl, and before witnesses too,
which made his discomfiture even more unpalatable.
While dining at Bonvalet’s restaurant, with his friend<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>
Saint-Arthur and the piquant little actress who was his
friend’s mistress, Jéricourt had had to submit to the raillery
of Beau Alfred, who, to compensate himself for
having been thrown down and having broken his suspenders,
had not ceased to repeat:</p>

<p>“It was Jéricourt’s fault! he was making love to the
flower girl, and there seemed to be no end to it; but the
pretty peddler didn’t bite at his gallantries&mdash;I fancy that
our dear friend will have nothing to show for his
seductive propositions. Ha! ha! ha! repulsed with
heavy loss by a flower girl! It’s incredible, it’s most annoying!
He doesn’t choose to admit it, but I am sure
that he’s terribly annoyed.”</p>

<p>And Mademoiselle Zizi, the young actress who was so
alluring in salacious rôles, and who perhaps had her own
reasons for taking the thing to heart, outdid the little
man in jocose remarks, and exclaimed with a most significant
glance at Jéricourt:</p>

<p>“Ah! that was well done! it was well done! How
pleased I am! I shouldn’t be any happier if I were offered
an engagement at the Palais-Royal! What a nice
little story to tell at the theatre! How they will laugh!&mdash;Ah!
so our author friends affect flower girls, do they?
that is very fine! Instead of sticking to actresses, who at
least are in their line, and whom it would certainly induce
to put more fire and talent into their parts&mdash;Ha! ha! to
make love to a flower girl, and to have nothing to show
for it! how humiliating!&mdash;Poor Jéricourt! he looks as
glum as an owl.<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>”</p>

<p>The young author, affecting the utmost tranquillity,
simply replied to these attacks:</p>

<p>“If that young flower girl should appear on the stage,
I’ll wager that she would eclipse many people who think
now that they have a hold on the public!”</p>

<p>“Is that meant for me?” cried Mademoiselle Zizi,
throwing a lobster claw in Jéricourt’s face.</p>

<p>“Why, no! of course not!” hastily interposed Saint-Arthur,
as the author did not respond. “For you! upon
my word! how can you imagine such a thing, when Jéricourt
is wild over your talent? For he has told me so a
hundred times; he says that you will replace Déjazet.&mdash;Haven’t
you said that to me often, Jéricourt?”</p>

<p>But the angry author continued to maintain an obstinate
silence, which increased the irritation of the little
actress.</p>

<p>“In any event,” she cried, “no one will be able to
judge of my talent in any of monsieur’s plays; for some
time past he has given me nothing but unimportant
parts.”</p>

<p>“I give you more than my brother authors do, for
they don’t give you any parts at all.”</p>

<p>“What does that prove? That all authors belong to a
coterie; that they allow themselves to be inveigled by
the prayers of this one and the enticements of that one,
or by the advice of the manager, who has his reasons for
looking after still another one. O the stage! O you
authors! it’s shocking, the injustice we have to put up
with; and then they throw a flower girl in our faces!<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>
and tell us that she has only to appear to leave us behind!
In that case, we’re only stop-gaps, eh?&mdash;Oh! it’s an
outrage! it’s abominable! O God! my nerves! I am
suffocating! I am dying!”</p>

<p>And Mademoiselle Zizi threw herself back on the
divan, stretching out her legs and arms, gnashing her
teeth, and wriggling like one possessed; whereupon
Beau Saint-Arthur quickly seized a carafe, exclaiming
in a tone of deep distress:</p>

<p>“The deuce! now she’s going to have a nervous attack;
that’s very pleasant. The devil take you, Jéricourt,
you’re the cause of it all; you spoke so roughly
to her! Look, see how rigid she is!”</p>

<p>“That will pass away!” replied Jéricourt very calmly,
helping himself to some truffled calves’ brains.</p>

<p><i>“Canaille!”</i> muttered Mademoiselle Zizi, still rigid.</p>

<p>And Alfred, as he approached his charmer with a glass
of cold water, was repulsed by her so sharply that a part
of the contents of the glass splashed in his face, while
the young woman muttered, taking pains to grind her
teeth together:</p>

<p>“I want my blue phial with the opal stopper; I must
have it.”</p>

<p>“Where is it, dear love? Shall I feel in your pocket?”</p>

<p>“Don’t come near me. My phial is at my rooms, on
my dressing table in the boudoir.”</p>

<p>“Very good&mdash;I’ll send a waiter.”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, I insist on your going yourself; the
waiter would make some mistake.<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t two blue phials, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I insist on your going yourself, or else I won’t try
to live.”</p>

<p>These last words were accompanied by such violent
gnashing of the teeth, that the affectionate Alfred, fearing
that his mistress would dislocate her jaw, hastened
to take his hat, saying to Jéricourt:</p>

<p>“I must humor her; you see what a paroxysm she is
having, and her blue phial contains some salt, I don’t
know what&mdash;some mixture that brings her round at
once. So that she often sends me to get it, for she never
remembers to take it with her. I will run to her house;
luckily it isn’t far&mdash;Rue Basse. But for all that it isn’t
amusing.&mdash;Don’t leave her, Jéricourt, above all things;
do what you can for her.”</p>

<p>“Never fear.”</p>

<p>The dandified Saint-Arthur, leaving Bonvalet’s, almost
ran to Rue Basse-du-Temple, and on reaching his mistress’s
abode, was received by her maid, who also was
dining, and who had hurriedly locked the dining-room
door, taking the precaution to remove the key; she
ushered the young lion into the salon, saying:</p>

<p>“Come in here, monsieur, and wait; I’ll go and fetch
madame’s phial.”</p>

<p>“I could have waited in the reception room just as
well; I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, monsieur, I should think not! I know
too well what I owe you; stay here, I won’t be long.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bring the wrong phial!<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s no danger of that&mdash;madame sends for it
often enough. I know what she uses it for.”</p>

<p>Left alone in the salon, Alfred lost patience; he returned
to the reception room, where he was nearer madame’s
boudoir; thereupon he heard quite distinctly the
rattle of knives and forks and glasses, and the popping
of corks, which sounds proceeded from the dining-room.</p>

<p>He even heard a sneeze, so loud that the doors shook.
But the maid returned with the blue phial with the opal
stopper and handed it to the young man, saying:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t monsieur stay in the salon? Perhaps
monsieur heard noises in the dining-room? Madame’s
two cats are dining with me; they amuse me and are
good company for me.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl, one of them has a cold in the head;
he sneezes pretty loud for a cat&mdash;loud enough to break
the windows.”</p>

<p>“Oh! monsieur is mistaken, the sneezing was in the
yard. The concierge does nothing else; it’s downright
disgusting!”</p>

<p>Paying no further heed to what the maid said, our
young elegant, armed with the precious phial, ran back
to the restaurant, and going at once to the door of his
private room, tried to open it; but to no purpose did he
turn the knob, the door was bolted inside.</p>

<p>Saint-Arthur began to knock and call.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? It’s I, Zizi!&mdash;Jéricourt! Why
do you lock yourselves in? What’s the meaning of this
jest?<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>”</p>

<p>“Have you brought the phial?” murmured the young
actress in an altered voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I’ve brought it.”</p>

<p>“Is it my blue phial?”</p>

<p>“To be sure; I know it well enough.”</p>

<p>“With the opal stopper?”</p>

<p>“The stopper is in it! It’s perfectly tight.”</p>

<p>“Well! take it back, that isn’t the one I want; I want
the yellow one with an agate stopper.”</p>

<p>“Oh! this is too much! Zizi, you abuse my good
nature.&mdash;Open the door, Jéricourt.”</p>

<p>“I should be delighted to, but madame says no. She
has taken a knife and threatens to bury it in her breast
if I take a step toward the door.”</p>

<p>“Oh! in that case, don’t budge, my friend! do me the
favor not to budge, stay where you are! I know the
mad creature; she would do some insane thing or other.
I will run and fetch the yellow phial!”</p>

<p>And the simple-minded fellow started off again to get
the yellow phial.</p>

<p>To those who say that this is an improbable incident,
we reply that we have seen such ladies make the man
whose fortune they were squandering do much more improbable
things; and, in truth, they are quite right to do
it, when they find blockheads ready to gratify all their
whims.</p>

<p>On returning with the yellow phial, Alfred opened the
door without difficulty. He found Jéricourt still at the
table, attacking the dishes with more ardor than ever;<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
and Mademoiselle Zizi, with cheeks as red as cherries,
flew into his arms, crying:</p>

<p>“I wanted to put your love and trust to the proof,
dear love, and you have come out triumphant from the
trial; you are worthy of my affection; I give it to you
once more, and more entirely; let me kiss you on the
left eye.”</p>

<p>Alfred submitted to the caress, smiling at Jéricourt
with an expression that seemed to say: “You see how
she loves me!”&mdash;And the dinner came to an end most
amiably; everybody was satisfied.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br /><br />
<small>THREE FOR A BOUQUET</small></h2>

<p>But the result of that dinner was that Jéricourt’s
thoughts recurred to Violette, and he said to himself:</p>

<p>“They made fun of me to-day on the subject of the
flower girl; if I don’t succeed with her, they will do it
again. That will injure my reputation; I shall seem as
big a donkey as Saint-Arthur. I have gone too far to
stop. Besides, the girl is so pretty! I am inclined to
think that I love her; I am not quite sure of it, but it
may be so. I did not lie when I said that she would outshine
Mademoiselle Zizi; she’s worth ten, yes, a hundred
Zizis!&mdash;I have an idea: suppose I should advise her to<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>
go on the stage? she would be a charming actress, and
I can find managers enough who will be delighted to
bring her out. I will give her lessons and advice.&mdash;By
Jove! that’s an excellent idea of mine. One of these
days I will work it into a vaudeville.&mdash;Violette will not
hold out against that proposition. The stage! the hope
of making a sensation on the boards, the pleasure of appearing
in a lot of unusual costumes&mdash;those things always
fascinate a girl. This one must be as much of a
coquette as the others, or she wouldn’t be a woman!
She will give way, and I shall triumph. A flower girl
turned into an actress&mdash;what would there be so surprising
in that? We have seen great talents start from much
lower down in the scale. And then, when a woman is
pretty, it takes so many difficulties out of the way. The
thing will go all alone.&mdash;I really must make a play out
of this idea.”</p>

<p>With such thoughts in his mind, Jéricourt came to the
Château d’Eau the next day, and he lost no time in accosting
the flower girl, who was still looking after the
young man who had found it so hard to leave her.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my lovely flower girl.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what a curt tone! I see that you are still angry
with me.”</p>

<p>“I, monsieur? Why so?”</p>

<p>“Why, on account of what I said yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I forgot that long ago! Such things go in at one
ear and out at the other; they never stay in my head.<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>”</p>

<p>“If they stayed in your heart, that would be better.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, my heart doesn’t waste any time on
such nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Violette, you will not always talk like
this, unless nature has given you a heart protected by a
triple steel cuirass.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t wear a cuirass, monsieur; a corset’s
quite enough!&mdash;Do you want to buy a bouquet, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“In a moment. I have many things to say to you,
and I would like to talk with you first.”</p>

<p>“If it’s to repeat what you said yesterday, I assure
you it isn’t worth while to begin the conversation.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid that I am going to talk of love?&mdash;You
have a way of saying things that is far from encouraging!”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! I don’t choose my words; I say just
what I think.”</p>

<p>“A woman who says what she thinks! do you know
that they are very rare?”</p>

<p>“I say, do you know that you ain’t very complimentary
to women? Have they caught you very often?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t what I meant. Look you, Violette, I
admit that I did wrong yesterday; I spoke to you as if
I were certain that you loved me, and you hadn’t given
me any right to do it.”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as you admit that you did wrong, that’s
the end of it, it’s all forgotten. Let’s talk about something
else.<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that my feeling for you has changed; on the
contrary, I adore you more than ever!”</p>

<p>“I say&mdash;it seems to me you’re beginning yesterday’s
song again!”</p>

<p>“No; yesterday I made certain propositions that displeased
you.”</p>

<p>“Pardi! they were very pretty, your propositions!
to dine with monsieur at a restaurant! to offer to furnish
lodgings for me! Why on earth don’t you marry me
and be done with it?”</p>

<p>“That might have come in time!”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the thirteenth arrondissement! But I prefer
the other twelve. As for furniture, I have some, monsieur,
and it’s my very own; Mère Gazon left it to me;
it ain’t violet wood, to be sure, but it’s good enough for
me; and besides, I think a great deal of it, in memory of
the one who gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“All that is very praiseworthy, no doubt; but I don’t
think that there’s anything wrong in trying to improve
one’s position, to make a fortune; that’s the object of
all who haven’t money, and no one has ever blamed
them.”</p>

<p>“Make a fortune! To be sure, that ain’t unpleasant,
that is, if you do it by honest means! If not, one had
better stay in one’s little corner.”</p>

<p>“Oh! bless my soul! who said anything about ceasing
to be honest? What extraordinary creatures these
girls are&mdash;always thinking that somebody means to lead
them astray!<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>”</p>

<p>“That’s because we know you, my fine gentlemen;
and, if I remember right, you didn’t propose to me yesterday
that I should become a <i>rosière</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The maiden who wins the rose offered as a prize for virtue in

<p>“Listen, Violette; I will come straight to the point.”</p>

<p>“Well! let us hear what your point is.”</p>

<p>“You have been to the play sometimes, of course?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, several times.”</p>

<p>“And you like it?”</p>

<p>“I should say that I do like it! I think it’s beautiful,
and if I was rich, I’d go often.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think of the actresses? Don’t you
think it must be delightful to appear in public, to be applauded,
to wear hundreds of different costumes, and to
be stared at and admired by a whole theatre full of
people?”</p>

<p>“Oh! how fast you go! That must be fine when one
has talent. I have seen some women who acted so well
that you couldn’t get tired listening to them; but I’ve
seen others who acted so poorly that everybody grumbled,
and laughed when they were trying to make you cry.
I have seen some pretty ones; but there are some terribly
ugly ones; and it’s no use for them to wear handsome
costumes and a lot of paint on their faces; it don’t make
them any better-looking.&mdash;But what makes you say all
this to me?”</p>

<p>“Because, Violette, if you choose to go on the stage,
it rests with you to do it; a glorious career is open to<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>
you, and I am sure that you will succeed, that you will
obtain glory and wealth at once!”</p>

<p>“I an actress!&mdash;Are you making fun of me again,
monsieur?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I am speaking in all seriousness. Listen
to me: I am a dramatic author, so that the stage is my
livelihood, or rather my constant study; therefore you
must admit that I ought to know something about it.
You have all that is needed for success on the stage: your
figure is well set up, you are tall but not too tall; your
face is lovely.&mdash;Oh! I am not paying compliments; indeed,
you must know that you are pretty, you have been
told so often enough! Your voice is clear and well
modulated; with all these advantages and the lessons I
will give you in declamation and in carrying yourself on
the stage, it is impossible that you should not make a
grand success. As for your getting a chance to make
your début, that is my concern; I will undertake that
and I shall have no difficulty. Better still, I will give
you a part, a splendid part, in my next play; and as a
reward of my zeal, of my lessons, of all that I will do
for you, I will not ask you for anything,&mdash;except a little
gratitude when you are a popular actress.&mdash;Well! what
do you say? isn’t that better than being a flower girl?”</p>

<p>“Is that all you’re buying this morning, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“But you don’t answer my proposition, Violette.
Don’t you understand that I am offering you a brilliant
future&mdash;all the enjoyments, all the pleasures of life?
And that won’t interfere with your remaining virtuous.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>”</p>

<p>“It’s too risky in that business! No, thank you, monsieur,
all this don’t tempt me; it amuses me to see other
people act, but it don’t make me want to act myself.
Everyone to his taste, and I prefer my flowers to your
stage.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! it isn’t possible that you refuse, when I
undertake to remove all obstacles.”</p>

<p>“Buy this bouquet;&mdash;just see what a pretty one it is,
and what a sweet smell! I’ll bet that it don’t smell so
good in your wings.”</p>

<p>“Surely, this isn’t your last word, Violette? You
will think it over, and you will accept.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my reflecting’s all done, monsieur; it don’t
take long with me; I know right off what suits me. I
don’t feel any calling for the stage.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t take the trouble to say any more, monsieur;
you’ll just waste your words, and that would be a pity,
as you make your business out of them, and you sell wit
on paper.”</p>

<p>Jéricourt was so vexed by the rejection of his proposition,
when he expected a complete triumph, that he was
tongue-tied, and could not think of a single word to
answer the flower girl.</p>

<p>At that moment he felt a hand on his arm, and someone
said to him:</p>

<p>“Good-day, Monsieur Jéricourt; I recognized you
from behind by your cane; I said: ‘That’s my neighbor’s
cane.’&mdash;How are you?<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>”</p>

<p>Jéricourt turned and found himself face to face with
the little young man who squinted so horribly and whom
we have already met at the Château d’Eau flower market,
with his mother and sister&mdash;Monsieur Astianax Glumeau,
whose room was on the floor above his parents, on the
same landing as Jéricourt’s apartment.</p>

<p>“Ah! is it you, young man?” said the author, as,
with a patronizing air, he offered a finger to little Astianax,
who deemed himself highly honored by that favor;
because, in his eyes, a man who wrote plays which were
actually performed was a demigod. “What are you
here for, my little rake? to buy a bouquet for some fair
one whom you are courting, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh! upon my word, Monsieur Jéricourt! I should
not dare&mdash;I am too young as yet. However, it isn’t the
inclination that is lacking.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, pray?”</p>

<p>“Nineteen.”</p>

<p>“At that age I had already had fifty love-affairs!”</p>

<p>“Oh! but you&mdash;an author&mdash;that’s a very different
matter; you weren’t shy.”</p>

<p>“I never was that; there is nothing more disastrous
for a man. If you take my advice, you will cure yourself
of that failing.”</p>

<p>“Papa and mamma don’t say so; they want to keep
me in leading strings like a poodle. Let them keep my
sister so if they choose; that’s all right&mdash;she’s a girl!
But me! Yes, you’re right; there’s nothing more foolish
than a bashful man. But I don’t propose to be bashful<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>
any more; I feel inclined to make people talk about me.&mdash;Were
you buying flowers, Monsieur Jéricourt?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that is to say, I was looking over them; I
haven’t decided yet.”</p>

<p>Little Astianax put his mouth to his neighbor’s ear and
whispered:</p>

<p>“The flower girl’s mighty pretty!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? That’s a matter of taste.”</p>

<p>“Hum! nonsense! Anybody can see that; I noticed
her yesterday; I came with mamma and my sister to buy
some flowers, because it was papa’s birthday. I didn’t
buy any; I gave him some nougat.”</p>

<p>“A very pretty bouquet that!”</p>

<p>“Oh! it doesn’t make any difference, I am going to
give him some flowers to-day; and I came here again,
for I dreamed of the flower girl all night.”</p>

<p>“Really!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I was a pacha and she was a slave.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said Jéricourt aloud, turning to Violette,
“here’s a young man who dreamed about you all
night, just because he saw you yesterday.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Astianax turned scarlet; he pulled the skirt
of Jéricourt’s coat and whispered: “Oh! I won’t tell
you anything more! You make me blush!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed; on the contrary, I am acting in
your interest; you are in love with mademoiselle&mdash;very
good, I tell her so for you. Who knows? perhaps you
will be more fortunate than the rest of us, especially as
you have all that a man requires to succeed.<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>”</p>

<p>Jéricourt uttered the last words in such an ironical
tone that any other than little Astianax would have taken
them in very bad part; but he, on the contrary, accepted
them as the truth; he smiled and twisted his mouth into
the shape of an ace of spades, while his eyes shot flames
to right and left.</p>

<p>Violette restrained the intense desire to laugh caused
by young Astianax’s contortions of feature; she said as
she arranged her flowers:</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur, choose. Do you want a bouquet?
Here’s a very pretty one,&mdash;as monsieur doesn’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that is to say, you must make me one; but
I’ll explain what you must put in it: I want some heliotrope&mdash;that’s
the flower of witty people; then some
myrtle&mdash;that means interest, affection; and a tulip in the
centre&mdash;that means an honest heart, decent behavior.”</p>

<p>“What, my dear Astianax, does the tulip mean all
that?” said Jéricourt, laughingly; “I should never have
suspected it. The devil! you are very learned about
flowers. Go on&mdash;what else do you want?”</p>

<p>“A few red carnations&mdash;they mean that one would
fight at need for the object of one’s love; I put them in
for myself, you understand; then a poppy and some immortelles&mdash;they
promise strength and health, and they
will please my father, for he is always thinking that he’s
sick; he took a bottle of lemonade only this morning&mdash;you
know, the kind of lemonade that purges.&mdash;Surround
the whole with pansies, and I shall have a bouquet full
of meaning&mdash;a genuine <i>selam</i>.<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>”</p>

<p>“Bravo, young man, bravo! With such bouquets you
will make your way very rapidly with the ladies!”</p>

<p>“This one is for papa; but later, I hope&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, monsieur,” said Violette, “but I
can’t make such a bouquet as you want; I have no red
carnations; you will hardly find any at this season, and
I haven’t any myrtle, or any poppies.”</p>

<p>“The devil! that’s annoying; but I should be sorry
to apply to another flower girl; on the contrary, I mean
to give you my custom.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure, monsieur, that no other flower girl
will have what you want&mdash;not in this quarter, at all
events. Take my advice, monsieur, and buy this bouquet
that I was offering to monsieur&mdash;just roses and violets;
it’s very pretty, and it’s the last one; I haven’t got anything
left to make one like it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say that it isn’t very nice, but it doesn’t express
my meaning&mdash;and it isn’t a <i>selam</i>, either.”</p>

<p>“But just see the pretty roses, the lovely buds! Anybody
would say it was a lovely bouquet.”</p>

<p>“And I agree with anybody; the bouquet is as pretty
as the seller; and faith! that’s saying a great deal!”</p>

<p>These last words were uttered by a gentleman of
mature years, dressed with some elegance, whose bearing,
whose manners, and whose smile even, instantly
pointed him out as one who frequented the best society.
His features were regular, refined and distinguished;
but they also indicated that their owner had taken a great
deal out of life; his face was worn, the flesh beneath<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>
his eyes was puffed out, his forehead and cheeks were
furrowed with wrinkles. In a word, he was naught but
a remnant of a very good-looking man, but he still had
the <i>comme il faut</i> manner, the intelligent eye, and the
slightly impertinent and satirical tone.</p>

<p>This individual was leaning on a very handsome cane,
holding in his right hand an eyeglass through which
he was examining Violette; he had paused in front of
her booth and listened to her last words; and with his
eyes fixed upon her lovely face, he muttered between his
teeth:</p>

<p>“It’s strange! there is a resemblance&mdash;to whom I
can’t say; but I know a face like that.”</p>

<p>Jéricourt and little Astianax were greatly surprised
when they saw the newcomer take the bouquet from the
girl’s hands, saying:</p>

<p>“How much for this bouquet?”</p>

<p>“Three francs, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Three francs! Pardieu! that’s nothing at all; bouquets
seem to be cheap in this quarter. I’ll take it. Here,
my pretty flower girl, pay yourself.”</p>

<p>And he handed Violette a five-franc piece; whereupon
little Astianax stood on tiptoe and cried:</p>

<p>“But I bargained for that bouquet before you did,
monsieur, and I am going to buy it. You can’t purchase
it, not you.”</p>

<p>The gentleman contented himself with a disdainful
glance at the young man as he repeated:</p>

<p>“Here, my girl, pay yourself.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>”</p>

<p>At this point Jéricourt thought fit to take part in the
discussion. He stepped between Astianax and the
stranger, and, assuming a self-sufficient tone, remarked
to the latter:</p>

<p>“I was the first one who negotiated for that bouquet;
so the flower girl has no right to sell it to anybody else,
as I am ready to pay the price she asked. Be kind enough
to give it to me, monsieur;&mdash;do you understand?”</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman simply turned his eyeglass on
Jéricourt, and holding his head a little sidewise, said
with an ironical smile:</p>

<p>“When I was your age, monsieur, I never allowed anything
that I had in hand to be taken from me, and I have
clung to that habit as I grew older;&mdash;do you understand?”</p>

<p>The gentleman’s self-assured manner and the tone of
persiflage in which he made this retort surprised our man
of letters, who did not know just what to do; but it
was not so with little Astianax, who was furious because
the stranger seemed to pay no heed to him, to treat him
like a child. He stepped up to him, looked him in the
face as well as he could, and shouted, in a voice which
anger made exceedingly shrill:</p>

<p>“I don’t know why monsieur didn’t answer me! You
see, I don’t allow myself to be insulted! I don’t propose
to be treated like a child, I don’t! I have plenty of
spunk, I have!”</p>

<p>“So! you are spunky, are you, my good friend?”
rejoined the gentleman, turning his glass upon Astianax.<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>
“Indeed! so much the better! I congratulate you, for
it may be a good thing for you when you grow up.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? when I grow up? I am nineteen years
old, monsieur, and at that age one isn’t afraid of anybody!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! nonsense! that isn’t possible! You
mean nine.”</p>

<p>This remark made little Astianax tremble with rage;
he stamped the ground and seemed disposed to rush at
the gentleman, who continued to stare at him and even
ventured to smile as he scrutinized him. Violette, fearing
that the little man would resort to violence, had risen to
restrain him, and Jéricourt, whom the quarrel seemed to
amuse, was wondering what would happen next, when
the scene changed as suddenly as when the manager’s
whistle is heard at the Opéra.</p>

<p>On the boulevard, however, Chicotin Patatras acted
once more as the scene-shifter.</p>

<p>Georget’s friend had been sauntering about the Château
d’Eau for several minutes; being desirous to spend
during the morning all the money that he had left from
the day before, the young rascal had breakfasted so
sumptuously that his brain was a little excited, and he
felt in the mood for perpetrating a practical joke. In
this frame of mind, he had noticed that several gentlemen
were standing in front of the flower girl’s booth, and he
soon recognized Jéricourt as the man whom he had tried
to throw down on the preceding day. He said to himself
instantly:<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a></p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I do to-day what I missed doing yesterday?
My little Georget don’t like that scented dandy;
he’s there again, prowling round the flower girl; if I
knock him over, I shall be doing a friend a favor, and
then too it’s fun for me. I must go about it playfully;
Chopard ain’t here to push me&mdash;that’s a shame.&mdash;Ah!
pardi! I’ll just go and grab that cabby’s glazed hat, as
he stands dreaming there by his horses; of course he’ll
chase me, and I’ll run between my man’s legs.”</p>

<p>Chicotin put his plan into execution forthwith. The
cabman, bereft of his hat, ran after the <i>gamin</i>, shouting
at the top of his lungs; he fled in the direction of the
flower girl and hurled himself suddenly against the legs
of someone, whom he bowled over, while the others
hastily stepped aside; but Chicotin had missed his aim
again; it was not Jéricourt, but little Astianax, who was
sprawling on the asphalt.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Mademoiselle Violette, it’s impossible
to stop in front of your booth, it seems!” said Jéricourt,
turning angrily away. “I congratulate you on the way
you treat your customers, and especially on the champion
you have chosen for that purpose. If it’s for him
that you insist on remaining a flower girl, it doesn’t
speak well for your taste.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? what did the dark-haired dandy say?”
cried Chicotin, rising and tossing the cabman his hat.
“I didn’t understand his apology.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the gentleman said,” exclaimed
Violette, “but I do know this, Monsieur Chicotin, that<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>
you have played the same trick two days in succession
on people who were standing in front of my shop; and
I propose that it shall stop; if not, I know to whom to
complain.”</p>

<p>During this exchange of words, young Astianax had
risen, with a lump on his forehead, and both knees of
his trousers torn; because he wore straps under his feet,
which inevitably caused the cloth to tear at the slightest
strain.</p>

<p>The rents that he saw in his trousers seemed to distress
young Astianax; he heaved a deep sigh and muttered:</p>

<p>“Sapristi! and it’s only the second time I have worn
them!”</p>

<p>Thereupon, giving no further thought to the bouquet
or to his quarrel, the little fellow walked rapidly away,
trying to hold his hands over the holes in his garments,
which his short coat did not cover.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the elderly gentleman had held the bouquet
in his hand, still leaning rather heavily on his cane.</p>

<p>“Nobody will dispute possession of these flowers with
me any more,” he said at last. “My two rivals have
abandoned the ground; it’s a dangerous place, it seems,
if I am to believe what that gentleman said.&mdash;Ha! ha!
you rascal! is it true that you amuse yourself throwing
down mademoiselle’s customers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! it’s only a joke, monsieur!” Chicotin replied
slyly; “but I have bad luck, I never hit the ones I aim
at.”</p>

<p>“Were you aiming at me, pray?<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, monsieur; of course not!”</p>

<p>“Because, you see, I have the gout, and if you had
knocked me down, it might have been a more serious
matter for me than for that little man, who ought not
to have lost the habit of tumbling yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! monsieur, if I had had that misfortune, I should
never have forgiven myself; but I’d have picked you up.”</p>

<p>“That would have been most generous on your part;
but I prefer that you shouldn’t have any occasion to
pick me up. You look to me like a genuine ne’er-do-well;
but I don’t dislike knaves of your sort.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur’s a good judge.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to come with me? I’ll give you an
errand to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, why not? And you won’t be sorry
that you chose me; I do errands in first-class shape!”</p>

<p>“Very good! if I am satisfied with you, I will give
you my work. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Chicotin&mdash;nicknamed Patatras because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Parbleu! I have a shrewd suspicion why you had
that name given you, if you always make your entrée
as you did just now, by throwing people down.&mdash;But this
pretty flower girl doesn’t like the way you treat her
customers, and she is right.”</p>

<p>“Bless me! monsieur,” said Violette, “it’s the second
time in two days that he has run into my counter like
that.”</p>

<p>“It’s the last time, Mamzelle Violette; I promise you
I won’t do it again; I’m done.<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>”</p>

<p>“This girl is really lovely!” muttered the gentleman,
as he paid for his bouquet. “Whom in the devil does
she look like? Faith! I’ve known so many!&mdash;Follow
me,” he said, turning to Chicotin.</p>

<p>He walked away, leaning on his cane and putting his
left foot to the ground with great precaution, which
necessarily kept him from walking fast.</p>

<p>And Monsieur Chicotin followed him, taking several
steps very rapidly, then falling back to cut a caper or
some monkey trick.</p>

<p>“If we keep on at this pace,” he said, “we shan’t
beat the railway train.”</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<br /><br />
A DOMESTIC INTERIOR</h2>

<p>In a very handsome salon of an apartment on Boulevard
Beaumarchais, in one of those fine houses recently
built, which make that quarter one of the most attractive
in Paris, three persons were assembled: Monsieur Glumeau,
his wife and his daughter.</p>

<p>We know the ladies. Monsieur Glumeau, formerly a
commission merchant, was a man of fifty years, of
medium height, who had never been handsome, but who
might have possessed some attractions when he was
young, thanks to his light hair, his china-blue eyes&mdash;there<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>
are people who like china-blue eyes&mdash;and above all, to
his slender figure, his shapely leg and his small and
well-arched foot. As he grew older, Monsieur Glumeau
had not taken on flesh like his excellent wife, but had
retained a youthful appearance, especially when seen
from behind; as to his face, that had become considerably
wrinkled, but his eyes were still china-blue, and
although he no longer possessed his fair hair, he had
replaced it by a wig of the same color.</p>

<p>It is probable that Monsieur Glumeau’s features would
not have undergone so sudden a revolution, except for
the mania that he had contracted of drugging himself,
of putting himself on strict diet for the slightest indisposition.
The dread of being ill constantly tormented
the ex-commission merchant, and by dint of taking care
of his health, he had succeeded in ruining it. His ordinary
reading was the fourth page of the large newspapers;
he took note of all the infallible remedies announced
and extolled by their inventors; he often bought
them although he had not the disease which they were
supposed to cure; but he would take them all as a matter
of precaution, saying to himself: “If I should have this
disease, I shall have the remedy at hand.”</p>

<p>To this weakness of mind, far from agreeable in a
family, Monsieur Glumeau added the pretension of shining
in conversation. He constantly sought to make
sharp or clever remarks; but as he was never able to
think of any, he often halted on the way, which fact
imparted much incoherency to his speech. Lastly, having<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>
formerly been what is called a fine dancer, he had retained
much liking for that exercise, wherein he could at
his pleasure exhibit his foot, of which he was very proud,
and upon which he kept his eyes fixed as he danced.</p>

<p>After retiring from business with a very considerable
fortune, which had recently been added to by an inheritance,
Monsieur Glumeau had purchased a country
house at Nogent-sur-Marne; there he had had built in
his garden a small theatre, where in the summer his
family and friends indulged in the pleasure of theatrical
performances, being actors and spectators in turn. Monsieur
Glumeau liked to receive company; the presence
of guests made him forget his imaginary diseases; as
his wife and his children were also fond of pleasure, the
ex-commission merchant’s house was one of those where
one was always certain to pass one’s time agreeably;
ceremony and etiquette were banished from it, and everyone
was at liberty to do what he pleased; the company
was sometimes a little mixed but it made up in quantity
what it lacked in quality.</p>

<p>At the moment of which we write, the head of the
family was in the act of drinking a cup of tea into which
he had squeezed the juice of a lemon, because when he
woke that morning he had a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>“I think that this will do me good,” said Monsieur
Glumeau, as he drank his tea in little sips; “lemon
juice in tea clears up the bile.”</p>

<p>“But why will you have it that you’re bilious, my dear?
Your complexion is very clear, you are not yellow.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>”</p>

<p>“You say I am not yellow, my dear love; that’s a
question! I am a little yellow&mdash;on one side of my nose;
and I don’t propose to wait until I am as yellow as a
pumpkin before I take a purgative.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you propose to purge yourself
again? That would be the last straw. You took
Sedlitz water a fortnight ago.”</p>

<p>“What does that prove, if I need it again?”</p>

<p>Madame Glumeau shrugged her shoulders, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“You make yourself sick by dosing yourself, Edouard!”</p>

<p>“Why no, my dear love, one doesn’t make oneself sick
by taking care of oneself; on the contrary, it prevents
one from being sick.”</p>

<p>“You know that we have company to dinner to-day.
I trust that you don’t propose to select this moment to
take medicine.”</p>

<p>“I am not talking about medicine to-day; but listen:
just now I was reading in my paper the announcement
of a most valuable discovery.”</p>

<p>“Something to prevent potatoes from being sick?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am not talking about potatoes!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, they are so useful, so nourishing, so
valuable, so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let me alone with your potatoes; I don’t like them.
What I am talking about is an infallible remedy for the
gravel.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t that, monsieur!”</p>

<p>“No, but I might have it!<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>”</p>

<p>“What a misfortune it is to be afraid of all diseases!”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of them, madame, but I simply am
on my guard against them; it isn’t from fear, it’s from
prudence, from common sense.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! if all men resembled you, it would
be amusing.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Lolotte?”</p>

<p>“I mean that by dint of thinking about diseases, you
think that you have them all, and it doesn’t tend to make
you a lively companion in society.”</p>

<p>“Madame, <i>si vis pacem, para bellum</i>.”</p>

<p>“What does that mean, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“If you wish for peace, prepare for war.”</p>

<p>“What connection has that with your lemon juice in
tea?”</p>

<p>“It also means: If you want to be well, look after
yourself as if you were ill.”</p>

<p>“Oh! as to that, I don’t believe a word of it; do I
dose myself, monsieur? and you see how well I am!”</p>

<p>“It is a fact that you are getting too stout, my dear
love; but if you would have consented to take a little
white mustard seed, you would have lost flesh.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, monsieur; I should probably have become
like a lath, and I prefer to remain as I am. To
hear you talk, one would say that I was enormous.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but you haven’t any waist.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any waist! I haven’t any waist! Upon my
word, I guess that it’s your eyes that are diseased; you
see crooked.<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>”</p>

<p>“What! why do you say that my eyes are diseased?
Is it because they are red? Don’t joke, Lolotte, are my
eyes swollen?”</p>

<p>“Ah! so I haven’t any waist! All men don’t think
as you do, monsieur, and in spite of my stoutness, if I
chose to listen to all the pleasant things that are said to
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Madame! you forget that your daughter is here.&mdash;Eolinde,
come and look at my eyes; it seems to me that
they sting.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Eolinde was looking over a volume of
plays; instead of answering her father, she cried:</p>

<p>“We must play <i>La Forêt Périlleuse</i>, papa, and I will
be the fair Ca&mdash;Ca&mdash;Camille!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child, yes, we have already decided to give
that play,” said Madame Glumeau; “and we are going
to have here to-day all the people who are to take part
in the first piece to be given at our country house, in
order to distribute the rôles. But the other piece is
what hasn’t yet been chosen. We must have a very lively
vaudeville.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! let’s give <i>Estelle, ou Le Père et La
Fille!</i>”</p>

<p>“I should like to know if you call that a lively vaudeville!
My dear girl, when we have theatricals in our
house, for our amusement, we mustn’t undertake to make
people weep, for the only result is to make them laugh.
As a general rule, you are all very bad, but that is what
is wanted; the worse actors you are, the more laughter<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>
you cause; if you acted well, it would be very dull, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! how you ta&mdash;ta&mdash;talk, just because
you&mdash;you&mdash;do&mdash;do&mdash;don’t act yourself!”</p>

<p>“If I did, I should try to be funny, that’s all; but I
should know my lines, I tell you that; and you never
know yours.”</p>

<p>During this conversation between the mother and the
daughter, Monsieur Glumeau had risen, had stationed
himself in front of a mirror, and was looking at his eyes
with a persistent scrutiny which finally ended in making
his sight blurred; whereupon he paced the salon, muttering:</p>

<p>“I must get some eye salve; I ought to have a recipe
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing the matter with your eyes, monsieur!”
cried Madame Glumeau impatiently; “you apparently
propose to make yourself blind now! Why don’t
you take the elixir of long life, and have done with it?”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be such a bad idea, madame!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! do as your friend Boutelet did. Do you
remember what happened to him, because he drank
heaven knows how many bottles of the elixir of long
life in six months? He died of it!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he would have died six months earlier if he
hadn’t drunk it!”</p>

<p>“After three o’clock and Astianax has not come home,”
said tall Eolinde; “it isn’t very kind of my brother, for
he was to bring us a collection of plays to choose from!<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it his neighbor, Monsieur Jéricourt, that
young author who lives on the fourth floor, who was to
lend your brother the plays?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma.”</p>

<p>“He has a very attractive look, has that young man,
we must invite him to come to our play in the country;
eh, Edouard?”</p>

<p>“I have no objection; isn’t he a newspaper man too?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that; we must try to have a few newspaper
men; they go everywhere in society, they write
articles about everything they see, and perhaps they
would speak of me in the paper, and I should see myself
in print; that would be very nice!&mdash;Whom have we to
dinner to-day?”</p>

<p>“Why, you must know as well as I do, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>bigre!</i> I really believe that I have a pain in my
stomach.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear! that would be the last straw.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s nothing, it’s going away; I was in a constrained
position.”</p>

<p>“We expect to dinner Monsieur and Madame Dufournelle;
Madame Dufournelle wants to act; she will be
terribly awkward on the stage, I fancy, but that’s her
business!”</p>

<p>“She is graceful and pretty, and I believe that she
will make a success of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s just like a man! to call that woman
pretty, just because she is always laughing, and because<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>
she is a great flirt; indeed she carries it so far sometimes
as to be almost indecent in her behavior with men!”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Lolotte! where did you see that?”</p>

<p>“I have seen it more than once; and in our own house,
in the country, with you, when she asked you to run after
her and defied you to catch her! Monsieur ran like a
deer, and then you both disappeared behind a hedge.&mdash;You
had no pain in your stomach that day!”</p>

<p>“Madame! really, you should not say such things;
your daughter can hear you.”</p>

<p>“My daughter will be married some day, monsieur,
and there’s no harm in her being warned beforehand of
the perfidy of the male sex. Besides, Madame Dufournelle’s
coquetry is evident to everybody. Her husband
sees nothing in all that! Poor fellow! so long as he
has somebody to play billiards with him, he doesn’t care
about anything else.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t jealous, madame, and he is very wise; that
proves that he has some intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you think that, do you? I have known husbands
of much intelligence who were as jealous as tigers!
Say rather that that fat Dufournelle is not in love with
his wife. Indeed, he’s too fat to be amorous.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! what spiteful creatures women are! If
a man is not jealous, it’s because he doesn’t love them.&mdash;I
suppose you’d like me to be jealous, madame?”</p>

<p>“You, Edouard! Merciful heaven! that’s all you
need,&mdash;to have that disease, with all those which you
think you have! that would be the climax!<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>”</p>

<p>“Say! suppose we play <i>Les B&mdash;b&mdash;bains à Do&mdash;do&mdash;domicile</i>?”
cried Eolinde, who was still looking over
the plays. “I would be Ninie.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl, do you intend to take all the parts in
the plays we give?” said Monsieur Glumeau, admiring
his feet. “It seems to me that if you take one part, that
will be quite enough; with your defective speech, you
know very well that you make plays last an hour longer
than they should, and you have a perfect mania for choosing
long parts! The last time we gave <i>Andromache</i>
everybody thought that your scene with Orestes would
never end!”</p>

<p>“Because it was in ve&mdash;verse, papa, which is harder
for me to pro&mdash;pronounce. But when it is p&mdash;p&mdash;prose,
it goes all by itself.”</p>

<p>“So I see! But why in the deuce did you insist on
giving a tragedy, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear, they were quite right!” said Madame
Glumeau; “for I assure you that they were enough to
make you die of laughter, and you yourself in Pylades,&mdash;bless
my soul! how fine you were!”</p>

<p>“Madame, you always take everything wrong. I
played Pylades very nicely, and if it hadn’t been for my
helmet, that kept falling down over my eyes and prevented
me from seeing the audience, I should have made
a very good impression.”</p>

<p>“Why, you did make a splendid impression, my friend!
you looked like a blind man, and that was much more
amusing!<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>”</p>

<p>“You are very satirical, my dear love; it is very easy to
see that you don’t act!”</p>

<p>“If I acted in private theatricals, I should never lose
my temper if people laughed at me.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with Monsieur Dufournelle?”</p>

<p>“He will prompt, that’s his forte! he puffs<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> all the
time like an ox!&mdash;We also expect little Kingerie; he’s a
very good fellow; he does whatever anyone wants him
to; he takes whatever parts you give him.”</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> The same word&mdash;<i>souffler</i>&mdash;means to prompt, and to blow or puff.</p></div>

<p>“Mamma, have you noticed that Monsieur Kingerie
has an entirely different voice when he sings, from the
one he has when he talks?”</p>

<p>“That’s true, but it’s very lucky for him; when he
talks, he always sounds as if he were hoarse; whereas,
when he sings, he has a little clear, flutelike voice, so
shrill that it is hard to believe that it is he who is singing.&mdash;Then
we shall have Monsieur Camuzard and his
daughter, Mademoiselle Polymnie, who also wants to act.”</p>

<p>“You must give her a part; she’s a very handsome
woman, tall and well-built and stylish!”</p>

<p>“She did her little s&mdash;s&mdash;soubrette part very badly the
l&mdash;l&mdash;last time, although she had only a few words to
say: ‘M&mdash;m&mdash;madame, the company is below in the
salon’; and she said: ‘Madame, the s&mdash;s&mdash;salon is
below in the c&mdash;c&mdash;company!’”</p>

<p>“That was because her tongue slipped! But it doesn’t
make it any the less true that Mademoiselle Polymnie
looks very well on the stage.<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>”</p>

<p>“Her nose is too big!”</p>

<p>“Big noses do very well on the stage. Besides, I
tell you again, daughter, that I desire to be polite to
Monsieur Camuzard, and I know that it gives him great
pleasure when his daughter acts.” And Monsieur Glumeau
added, with a glance at his wife: “We must try
to make Astianax act a lover’s part, and let Mademoiselle
Polymnie be the sweetheart. You understand my ideas
and my plans, don’t you, Lolotte?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, they are not hard to understand. Mademoiselle
Camuzard would be an excellent match, I
know; but Astianax is still so young!”</p>

<p>“I married very young myself, madame, and I have
never repented it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s the nicest thing you have said to-day!”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that I say nice things very often; but
you don’t notice them because you are used to them.&mdash;This
tea has done me good; I feel as light as a bird; I
would like to dance a mazurka.&mdash;Speaking of dancing,
Eolinde, have you practised on your piano the new quadrilles
that I brought you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! they are too hard.”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle, it’s because you don’t choose to
take the pains to study; and you are all the more wrong
in that, because everybody plays the piano now; young
men and young girls, everybody knows how to play for
dancing; the young woman who did not know how to
play a quadrille in company would be looked upon as a
savage, as a Hottentot!<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>”</p>

<p>“I know very well that everybody pl&mdash;plays the piano
now. The c&mdash;c&mdash;concierge’s daughter plays it; and the
other day the l&mdash;l&mdash;locksmith who c&mdash;c&mdash;came to fix a
lock which wouldn’t l&mdash;l&mdash;lock, said when he heard me
pl&mdash;playing: ‘I play the piano myself Sundays, when I
have time.’&mdash;Isn’t that so, mamma?”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth; indeed I was tempted to say to the
locksmith that he ought to put over his shop door:
‘Bells hung with piano accompaniment!’”</p>

<p>“In fact, papa, the p&mdash;p&mdash;piano has become such a
common inst&mdash;st&mdash;strument, that I would rather play
something else.”</p>

<p>“What, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“Why, the little flute, for example.”</p>

<p>“You are mad, Eolinde; it would be very pretty to see
a young lady playing on the flute! Wind instruments
are exclusively for men.”</p>

<p>“Why is that, papa?”</p>

<p>“Why, because, as Apollo played the flute when he
kept flocks, and as that god was the god of melody, the
pipes and the flute&mdash;By the way, Lolotte, I hope you
told Chambourdin to come; he’s a very pleasant fellow,
a leader in all sorts of fun, always merry and a
true sport. He will act, and I’ll wager that he’ll be most
amusing!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know, monsieur, that we can’t rely on
your Chambourdin? You know very well that he never
keeps his word; when he promises to come, that’s the
end of it. If we relied on him to take a part, he would<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>
spoil the whole performance. But we shall have Monsieur
Mangeot and his sister; they are obliging and
agreeable. Monsieur Mangeot takes the part of clowns
and mimics very well; he plays carefully and always
knows his part, and so does his sister.”</p>

<p>“True, but as his sister is extremely hard of hearing,
she always has to stand within two steps of the prompter,
which is a great nuisance for the action of the play; and
sometimes too she talks at the same time that her opposite
is talking.&mdash;<i>Bigre!</i> here comes that pain in the
stomach again. What can it be? Did we have mushrooms
yesterday, Lolotte?”</p>

<p>“Mushrooms? there were some in the vol-au-vent we
had; but everybody ate some of it, and it didn’t make
anybody sick.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t prove anything; sometimes it doesn’t
show itself until late; Eolinde, you haven’t a pain in
your stomach, have you?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, papa.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by on the contrary; you either
have a pain, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, s&mdash;s&mdash;since I&mdash;I say on the c&mdash;c&mdash;contrary!”</p>

<p>“My child, your answers are very foolish.&mdash;If this
doesn’t go away, I will tell the maid to prepare me an
enema of marshmallow.”</p>

<p>“Please remember that the maid is getting her dinner
ready; she is looking after her kitchen fire, and how do
you suppose that she can leave that to make you an
enema?<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for that; if I am ill, it seems to me that
it is more important to take care of me than to get the
dinner.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, we have ten people to dinner, and it’s
after four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Then, madame, go and prepare it for me yourself.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! just for a paltry pain in the stomach!
Often it doesn’t amount to anything; go&mdash;somewhere,
monsieur, and it will pass away.”</p>

<p>“I shall not go anywhere, madame, because I have no
desire to.”</p>

<p>“Papa, suppose we should play <i>Pourceaugnac</i>?”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, my child; you tire me!”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Eolinde!” said Madame Glumeau with a
sigh, “why should we play <i>Pourceaugnac</i> on our little
stage; we play it often enough in our family, as well as
<i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i>!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau was about to reply to his wife when
the bell rang.</p>

<p>“Company! company already!” cried stout Lolotte,
“and I haven’t finished dressing!”</p>

<p>“And my enema, madame! I must have it!” said her
husband in an altered voice.</p>

<p>“No doubt it’s my brother,” replied tall Eolinde in
her turn; “it isn’t worth while to put ourselves in such
a flurry for him!<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br /><br />
<small>THE ELUSIVE REMEDY</small></h2>

<p>But the salon door opened, and Monsieur Dufournelle
and his wife appeared.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dufournelle was a stout party of forty-five,
with a jovial face which denoted a frank and hearty disposition.
His wife, who was hardly thirty, was pretty,
had a good figure, and laughed all the time; it is needless
to say that she had fine teeth; if they had been ugly
she would not have laughed on all occasions.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, my friends!” said Monsieur Dufournelle,
with an “ouf!” which sent the sheets of
music scattered over the piano flying about the room.
“We have come early; it’s bad form, but we don’t care
for that!&mdash;You are all well, my dear friends?”</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;extremely well! It is so nice of you to
come early!” said Madame Glumeau, dissembling a slight
grimace.</p>

<p>“I remarked to my husband,” rejoined the lady with
the fine teeth, “that perhaps it would be discourteous for
us to come before five o’clock; but he replied that we
didn’t stand on ceremony with you.”</p>

<p>“And he was right, he was quite right!” said Monsieur
Glumeau, pressing one of his hands to his stomach;<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>
then he turned to his daughter and muttered: “The
devil take them! I want my enema!”</p>

<p>“Besides, we have lots of things to talk about,” said
Madame Dufournelle; “aren’t we to distribute the parts
to-day for our performance?&mdash;Ha! ha! what fun it will
be! I have never acted, but I am looking forward to it.
Ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Would you believe that my wife hasn’t talked about
anything else for a fortnight, and I have to take her to
the theatre every night, because she claims that that is
like giving her lessons! One day she tries to imitate
Scriwaneck, another time Mademoiselle Fargueil; then
it’s Aline Duval whom she tries to mimic, or else pretty
Alphonsine, or Grassot.”</p>

<p>“Oh! really, Monsieur Dufournelle, what are you
talking about? Imitate Grassot indeed! do you suppose
that I mean to take men’s parts? Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I assure you that you caught some
of Grassot’s intonations when you were rehearsing&mdash;I
don’t know what rôle.&mdash;But where is our dear little
Astianax? aren’t we to see him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, you will see him; he should be at home
before this; I don’t know where he can have gone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that he’s gone to get a b&mdash;b&mdash;bouquet for
p&mdash;p&mdash;papa.”</p>

<p>“A bouquet! what! it can’t be that it’s Glumeau’s
birthday?”</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t this Saint-Honoré’s day?”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! and we never thought of it, Eléonore?<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>”</p>

<p>“That is true, my dear; we are very thoughtless!”</p>

<p>“All the same, my dear friend, I wish you many happy
returns; the bouquet will come later!”</p>

<p>“Thanks! thanks!” replied Glumeau, with a significant
glance at his wife. “At this moment, a bouquet
isn’t what I want.”</p>

<p>“I must go and complete my toilet,” said the buxom
Lolotte, answering her husband’s signs with a wink.
“You will excuse me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Excuse you? why, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go and do&mdash;do what you have to do!” cried
Glumeau, staring at his feet with a distressed expression.
“And I will come too.”</p>

<p>“You see, we came too early!” said Madame Dufournelle;
“we are in the way.”</p>

<p>“Why, not at all! you see that we do not stand on
ceremony.”</p>

<p>As Madame Glumeau was about to leave the salon,
the door opened, and an old and exceedingly ugly man in
blue spectacles entered, escorting a tall and well-built
young lady, dressed with affected elegance, and endowed
with one of those faces that never change.</p>

<p>“Monsieur and Mademoiselle Camuzard!” cried Madame
Glumeau, turning back to welcome the newcomers.
“How good of you to come early! Pray come in.&mdash;Edouard,
here are Monsieur Camuzard and Mademoiselle
Polymnie.”</p>

<p>Edouard had gone to examine his complexion in the
mirror; when he saw that more guests had arrived, he<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>
uttered a hollow groan, then did his utmost to assume a
smiling countenance, saying to himself:</p>

<p>“I shall never be able to take my enema! this is getting
to be very alarming!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Polymnie had in her hand a huge bouquet,
which she presented to Glumeau, saying:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, will you allow me to wish you a happy
birthday?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, mademoiselle, with the greatest pleasure;
I am deeply touched. What a superb bouquet! You are
too kind.”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! how sorry I am that we didn’t bring one!”
exclaimed Dufournelle again, while his wife laughed
heartily as she looked at the pictures on the music and at
Mademoiselle Camuzard.</p>

<p>“How is your health, my dear Glumeau?” inquired
the old gentleman, shaking his host’s hand violently.</p>

<p>“Very good, Monsieur Camuzard; my health is very
fair, although it isn’t all that I could wish.”</p>

<p>“Are you in pain?&mdash;I have pains in my knees and
arms; and it keeps catching me here, you see, and extends
all the way down my back.”</p>

<p>“It’s not my back that troubles me, it’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And then I cough a great deal every morning when
I wake up; there are days when I have regular paroxysms.”</p>

<p>“I don’t cough, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And then I expectorate very freely! Oh! I don’t try
to stop that&mdash;it does me good.<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>”</p>

<p>“This is not a very amusing conversation!” said Madame
Dufournelle in an undertone to her husband; he
frowned at his wife, to enjoin silence upon her, whereupon
she went to Mademoiselle Eolinde.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said, “what are we to act? have you decided
on the plays? What part are you going to give
me? I want a pretty costume.”</p>

<p>“You see how co&mdash;co&mdash;coquettish she is!” said Mademoiselle
Glumeau, turning to her mother; “the co&mdash;costume
is the first th&mdash;th&mdash;thing she th&mdash;thinks of.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t yet decided on the whole entertainment,”
said Madame Glumeau; “we are waiting until our whole
troupe has arrived.”</p>

<p>“If you need me,” said Monsieur Camuzard, “don’t
hesitate; I’ll play any small part, or a utility rôle.”</p>

<p>“It’s to be hoped that we shall not need him!”
whispered Madame Dufournelle to her husband; “he’s
altogether too hideous; he looks like a bird of prey.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Eléonore, I beg you.”</p>

<p>“My dear love, pray go and attend to what you have
to do,” said Monsieur Glumeau, looking at his wife.
“Our friends will excuse you; they know that the mistress
of the house always has orders to give.”</p>

<p>“Do go, dear lady; your charming daughter is here
to do the honors, you know.”</p>

<p>“Since you are good enough to excuse me&mdash;I have
something to attend to.”</p>

<p>“Would you like me to come and help you?” inquired
Madame Dufournelle; “dispose of me.<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! you are too kind; I don’t need any help for
what I have to do; I will return in a moment.”</p>

<p>And the mistress of the house was once more on the
point of leaving the room, when the door opened again
to admit two other guests, a gentleman and a lady, both
of mature years, who came forward smiling pleasantly at
the company.</p>

<p>“Monsieur and Mademoiselle Mangeot!” exclaimed
Madame Glumeau, who was obliged to step back as she
curtsied, because the newcomers came straight toward
her. “How very good of you to come early!”</p>

<p>“Why, you said five o’clock, and it is just about to
strike the hour,” replied the gentleman, bowing low.
“I am as exact as a pendulum; I hurried my sister who,
I thought, would never finish arranging her hair; I
always dread being late.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my brother wanted to ride,” said Mademoiselle
Mangeot, “but I reminded him that we should arrive
sooner on foot than in an omnibus.&mdash;Will you allow me to
wish you a happy birthday, Monsieur Glumeau?”</p>

<p>And the middle-aged damsel, producing a pretty little
bouquet of <i>pompon</i> roses, which she had under her
shawl, presented it to Glumeau, who smelt it, making a
peculiar face, and replied:</p>

<p>“Really, mademoiselle, you overwhelm me&mdash;<i>pompon</i>
roses!”</p>

<p>“You are fond of them, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I am very fond of them&mdash;but not too hot.”</p>

<p>“What! are there such things as hot bouquets?<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg pardon, mademoiselle, I made a mistake;
I meant to say that it would give me great pleasure to
take it now.”</p>

<p>“Why, take it then, monsieur; as you see, I am offering
it to you for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“To be sure&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I am absent-minded; I
do take it&mdash;that is to say, yes, I accept these lovely
roses.”</p>

<p>“You take them awkwardly; you will prick yourself;
you should let me put them in myself.”</p>

<p>“Put them where, pray?”</p>

<p>“Why, in your buttonhole.”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! how annoyed I am that I didn’t bring a
bouquet!” repeated stout Dufournelle; and Mademoiselle
Eolinde, overhearing him, muttered between her
teeth:</p>

<p>“He s&mdash;s&mdash;says that every year, but he n&mdash;n&mdash;never
brings one.”</p>

<p>“My dear Monsieur Glumeau,” said Monsieur Mangeot,
stepping forward to shake hands with the master
of the house, who seemed determined to keep his hands
pressed against his abdomen, “pray accept my good
wishes also, and may I be able to offer them again a hundred
years hence.&mdash;That’s not a new idea, but it’s always
good!&mdash;And the dear boy, the charming Astianax, where
is he, pray?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine!” said Madame Glumeau; “to think
of his not being here yet&mdash;to-day of all days! Really,
I am beginning to be anxious.<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>”</p>

<p>“You know, mamma, that my b&mdash;b&mdash;brother was going
to order a b&mdash;b&mdash;bouquet full of meaning; no d&mdash;d-doubt&mdash;no
doubt that is what is k&mdash;k&mdash;keeping him.”</p>

<p>“What on earth is a bouquet with a meaning?” inquired
Monsieur Camuzard.</p>

<p>“It’s a <i>selam</i>, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Ah! and what might a <i>selam</i> be?”</p>

<p>“It’s a bouquet with a meaning.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!”</p>

<p>“When a man has a daughter named Polymnie, he
ought to be more learned,” said Madame Dufournelle
laughingly to Mademoiselle Mangeot; and she, being a
little hard of hearing, replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it will be fine.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame Glumeau, noticing her husband’s
repeated signals, determined to leave the salon without
asking leave of the latest comers. And fearing that
other guests might arrive to detain her, she made her
escape by a door leading to her bedroom.</p>

<p>When he saw his wife disappear, Monsieur Glumeau
uttered an exclamation of satisfaction which was drowned
by the arrival of Monsieur Kingerie, the young man who
did whatever anyone desired. He was a little fellow, who
always acted as if he were ashamed of himself; on entering
the room, he began by blushing to the ears, ran into
a chair that was between himself and the master of the
house when he attempted to salute him, and as he rose
after picking up the chair, he ran his head into Monsieur
Glumeau’s stomach. That gentleman uttered a savage<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>
oath, while the timid Kingerie, distressed beyond words
at what he had done, hastily stepped back and trod on
Mademoiselle Mangeot’s foot; and as she was afflicted
with corns, she pushed the awkward youth violently away,
whereupon he collided with Monsieur Camuzard, causing
his spectacles to fall off.</p>

<p>Madame Dufournelle laughed until she cried, saying
to her husband:</p>

<p>“Pray stop that gentleman or he will upset the whole
company.”</p>

<p>They got young Kingerie seated at last; he was at a
loss to apologize for his awkwardness and seemed disposed
to weep; but, luckily for him, other guests arrived,
so that he ceased to monopolize the attention.</p>

<p>First, there was a gentleman of very attractive appearance
and with a distinguished air, whom they called Monsieur
de Merval; he entered the salon with the ease of
manner born of familiarity with good society, saluted
one and all without knocking anybody down, and shook
hands with Monsieur Glumeau without hitting him in the
stomach. Although Monsieur de Merval was no longer
a young man, he was still most attractive; which was
proved by the fact that when he entered the salon, all
the ladies, young and old, drew themselves up, and composed
their features and their bearing; you will never
see a woman do all that for a man who is not worth the
trouble.</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau, who seemed to have much consideration
for Monsieur de Merval, forgot for a moment<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>
the remedy he was awaiting, to say to him some of those
courteous phrases which people exchange in society, as
we exchange silver for small coins.</p>

<p>“I do not see madame,” replied the newcomer, after
paying his respects to Mademoiselle Eolinde.</p>

<p>“Mamma will be here d&mdash;d&mdash;directly; she has g&mdash;g&mdash;gone
to pre&mdash;pre&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My wife has gone to see if dinner will be served
soon,” hastily interposed Monsieur Glumeau. “The
master’s eye, you know, or rather the mistress’s, is always
indispensable when one entertains a few friends.”</p>

<p>“And your son?”</p>

<p>“My son&mdash;I can’t understand his absence; he should
have been here long ago; something has happened&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“P&mdash;p&mdash;papa, I think I hear my b&mdash;b&mdash;brother’s voice
in the d&mdash;d&mdash;dining-room; he’s with Monsieur Cha&mdash;Chambourdin.”</p>

<p>“That’s very fortunate; we shall know in a minute
what has detained him.”&mdash;And Monsieur Glumeau
whispered in his daughter’s ear: “Go and see if your
mother has prepared&mdash;you know what. I must have it.”</p>

<p>“But p&mdash;p&mdash;papa, I c&mdash;c&mdash;can’t&mdash;can’t leave the s&mdash;s&mdash;salon
n&mdash;now; that would l&mdash;l&mdash;leave only you with the
g&mdash;g&mdash;guests, and you’re not very b&mdash;b&mdash;brilliant.”</p>

<p>“Parbleu! you must come in with me, you rascal!”
exclaimed a young man, the possessor of a comely face,
but with an absolutely bald head, who entered the salon
at that moment, dragging young Astianax, who had his
hands over the rents in his trousers.<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a></p>

<p>“Mesdames and messieurs, I have the honor to present
a young man who was scampering upstairs, without
stopping at his worthy father’s door; but I seized him
on the wing, saying: ‘My dear boy, it is too late to go
up to your room; the paternal arms await you and the
soup must be served.’&mdash;Still, he wouldn’t come, and you
see now how he objects to coming in.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean, my son?” inquired Monsieur
Glumeau, after shaking the hand that Chambourdin offered
him. “Why do you stand there at the door and
not come in?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, father&mdash;allow me to go up to my room a
moment; I will come right down again; it is impossible
for me to face our guests at this moment.”</p>

<p>“What! impossible? why, you’re facing them now.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t see that the boy is dressed like a wild
Indian, either!” said Chambourdin, as he saluted the
ladies.</p>

<p>“My dear good father, I assure you that I have something
on that is&mdash;is not presentable.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! c&mdash;c&mdash;can it be that my b&mdash;b&mdash;brother
has the same trouble as p&mdash;p&mdash;papa?” said tall Eolinde
to herself; “does he want one t&mdash;t&mdash;too?”</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau, who had had the same thought as
his daughter, dared say nothing more; but the bald
youth, who was in the habit of playing jokes in company,
and who was very unceremonious wherever he
went, crept noiselessly behind the son of the house, and,
giving him a sharp push, forced him to pitch forward<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>
into the salon; and in that movement Monsieur Astianax
was obliged to remove his hands from his knees, thus disclosing
the two rents; whereupon everybody uttered an
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Great heaven!”</p>

<p>“Ah! the poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“Both knees torn! he must have fallen.”</p>

<p>“You fell, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“How does it happen, my son, that those trousers,
which are almost new, are torn on both knees?”</p>

<p>“Well! now you know why I didn’t want to come in&mdash;you
see that I was right. Am I presentable like this?”</p>

<p>“But, my son&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is I who am to blame for everything!” cried Chambourdin;
“I forced him to disclose his disaster. Strictly,
I ought to lend him some trousers, but as I believe he
has another pair, I prefer that he should wear his own.&mdash;Go,
hapless victim of a slippery sidewalk, but don’t be
long! something tells me that the soup is not far away.”</p>

<p>Little Astianax disappeared, and Monsieur Glumeau
would have been glad to do as much, but his guests surrounded
him and talked to him; he was hemmed in on
all sides.</p>

<p>“Everybody must have come, is it not so, my dear
friend?” said Chambourdin, offering him snuff in one
of those snuff-boxes known as <i>rat-tails</i>.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, and it’s very lucky&mdash;otherwise there
would be thirteen of us,” replied Glumeau, writhing about
as inoffensively as possible.<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a></p>

<p>“Thirteen! I had just as soon sit thirteen at table.
Truffles, champagne, chambertin and thirteen at table
every day&mdash;I’ll subscribe for that if I don’t have to pay
in advance.”</p>

<p>“Or if you don’t have to pay afterward, perhaps?”
said Monsieur Dufournelle.</p>

<p>“Oh! what a spiteful thing to say, big Dufournelle!
How fat the fellow is growing! If he keeps on he won’t
be able to go into any house; partitions of decent dimensions
no longer conceal him&mdash;he will have to have some
made expressly for him.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, advocate without causes!”</p>

<p>“I an advocate? Oh! I have abandoned the profession;
I wasn’t loquacious enough, and then I was too
good a fellow. I settled disputes on the instant. I induced
the parties to dine together and I dined with them;
we all got tipsy; after dinner they embraced and that
was the end of their litigation. My confrères begged me
to give up practice&mdash;I was ruining the profession.”</p>

<p>“Whom else do you expect, Monsieur Glumeau?” inquired
Monsieur Camuzard.</p>

<p>“A lady&mdash;a charming lady&mdash;not very young, but very
good-looking still.”</p>

<p>“And her name?”</p>

<p>“The Baronne de Grangeville.”</p>

<p>“A baroness! the deuce! a real baroness?”</p>

<p>“I never knew a sham one.”</p>

<p>“I was joking.&mdash;Is she married?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s a widow.<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oho! a widow, eh? And rich?”</p>

<p>“I believe that she is very rich.&mdash;But I beg pardon&mdash;I
have to say a word to my daughter.”</p>

<p>“I can’t conceive what your mother is doing!” said
Glumeau in his daughter’s ear. “I can’t remain in this
plight. Something must have happened to the instrument.
Go and see, Eolinde, and urge your mother to
make haste.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Eolinde was sorely vexed to be obliged
to leave the company; she went out of the room with a
sulky expression, and without acknowledging the fifth
bow that young Kingerie addressed to her.</p>

<p>“Something out of the natural course is going on
here,” said Madame Dufournelle to her husband; “Madame
Glumeau goes out and does not return; the son’s
trousers are all torn, and he disappears; the daughter has
left the salon in a pet; Monsieur Glumeau stands first on
one leg, then on the other; he frowns and doesn’t pay
any attention to the conversation. There certainly is
something wrong!”</p>

<p>“Some dish spoiled, or some entrée from the restaurant
that hasn’t come, perhaps; or rather, they are making
great preparations to receive this baroness whom
they expect.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! really? a baroness of what?”</p>

<p>“What do you say? a baroness of what?&mdash;A baroness,
that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>“And that’s why these ladies leave us like this! Aren’t
we as good as a baroness, I should like to know?<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>”</p>

<p>“Hush, Eléonore!”</p>

<p>“Bah! I don’t care a snap of my finger for their
baroness!”</p>

<p>“It’s after half-past five,” said Monsieur Mangeot to
his sister; “I trust they will give us some dinner soon;
I am half starved!”</p>

<p>“I fancy that you have time to tighten your waistband;
they are expecting a baroness, so Monsieur Camuzard
told us just now.”</p>

<p>“Oho! confound it! I must admit that at this moment
I would much rather see a stuffed turkey than a
baroness. They are capable of making us wait till six
o’clock. I don’t know anything more intolerable than
not to give your guests their dinner at the appointed time.
If you mean to dine at half-past six, don’t invite me at
five; for otherwise, I would make my arrangements
accordingly and take something to stay my stomach.&mdash;Ah!
the door opens&mdash;it is the long-desired baroness, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s Madame Glumeau coming back.”</p>

<p>The buxom Lolotte had, in fact, reappeared in the
salon; she tried to catch her husband’s eye, but she was
obliged to stop and welcome the guests who had arrived
during her absence. She had much ado to get rid of
Monsieur Chambourdin, who embraced her, and of young
Kingerie, who trod on her dress. At last she succeeded
in joining Edouard, whose contortions were becoming
alarming, and whispered to him:</p>

<p>“It’s all ready in your dressing-room.<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>”</p>

<p>Glumeau’s face beamed.</p>

<p>“Go, my dear,” his wife added aloud, “and see if the
table is laid as you wish; if the names of the guests are
arranged to your satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are right; I will go; but we can’t sit
down, you know, until Madame de Grangeville comes.”</p>

<p>“All right, all right! but go.”</p>

<p>Glumeau did not wait to be told again; he hurried
toward the door, saying to himself:</p>

<p>“At last I can take it!”</p>

<p>But as he opened the door, he found himself face to
face with a very fashionably dressed lady who was just
about to enter. The unhappy host stopped short, saying:</p>

<p>“It is written that I shall not take it!”</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<br /><br />
<small>THE BARONNE DE GRANGEVILLE</small></h2>

<p>The Baronne de Grangeville, the latest arrival at Monsieur
Glumeau’s, was a lady who had once been exceedingly
pretty, and who was still rather attractive; by
artificial light she appeared no more than thirty-six years
old; by daylight, about thirty-nine; we are not certain
how she appeared by twilight.</p>

<p>It might be that Madame de Grangeville had not
passed her fortieth birthday, but it would have been<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>
dangerous to make that assertion, because she was always
so carefully gotten up, even in the most trivial details
of her toilet, because she was always dressed in such
perfect taste, made use of such delicious perfumery, and
carried herself so gracefully, that she would inevitably
be always young.</p>

<p>The baroness’s arrival created a sensation in Monsieur
Glumeau’s salon, for it should be said that none of the
guests there assembled had previously met that lady, to
whom the Glumeaus had been introduced at a third
house, where, delighted with her affability, they had invited
her to dine with them.</p>

<p>The master of the house, despite his interesting situation,
could not do otherwise than offer the lady his hand
to escort her to his wife, who received the baroness
with an effusion of cordiality and satisfaction which
seemed overdone to some of the guests.</p>

<p>“She is very good-looking,” said Monsieur Dufournelle
to his wife, who whispered:</p>

<p>“No! you should say, she has been.”</p>

<p>“But I say yes, she is now; she is a person who still
makes conquests, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I am glad to hear that, my dear; it makes me
think that I shall continue to be attractive for a long
time to come.”</p>

<p>“A lovely dress, a very distinguished bearing!” said
Monsieur Camuzard to his daughter.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Polymnie scrutinized it all without winking,
and replied simply:<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></p>

<p>“Her dress is too long-waisted.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the facetious Chambourdin, tapping
Monsieur Mangeot on the shoulder, “that’s rather a
dainty bit still, eh? What do we think of it, friend Mangeot?”</p>

<p>“I think that it’s almost six o’clock, and that I am
starving to death!”</p>

<p>“As the baroness has arrived, dinner will probably be
served.”</p>

<p>“Why, no&mdash;look&mdash;there’s Glumeau running away now!
Do you see how he slinks off? Where in the devil can
he be going?”</p>

<p>“We must keep him here.”</p>

<p>But the gentlemen were too late that time; Monsieur
Glumeau finally succeeded in leaving the salon; he would
have left one of his coat tails there rather than not go.</p>

<p>Amid all the reflections and comments to which Madame
de Grangeville’s entrance had given rise, a single
person had said not a word&mdash;that person was Monsieur
de Merval. However, he had scrutinized the baroness
no less closely, perhaps even more closely, than the others
had done, and his expression, as he looked at her, seemed
to indicate that it was not the first time that he had seen
her; being a man of the world, however, he was able to
conceal his sensations.</p>

<p>As for her who was at that moment the cynosure of
every eye, she was not embarrassed for an instant by all
the glances that were bent upon her; smiling at one and
all most graciously, acknowledging Madame Glumeau’s<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>
curtsies, addressing a pleasant word to Mademoiselle
Eolinde, she displayed as much ease of manner as if she
were in her own house until the moment that her eyes
met Monsieur de Merval’s. Then a surprised expression,
a faint suggestion of dismay, blended with the smile that
played constantly about her lips; but, like Monsieur de
Merval, she speedily recovered her self-possession; her
emotion was only momentary.</p>

<p>Young Astianax reappeared in other clothes and was
greeted with cheers by Chambourdin and Dufournelle,
who told him that all the ladies had looked at his
trousers.</p>

<p>The little fellow lost no time in presenting his respects
to the Baronne de Grangeville, to whom he delivered a
complimentary address that lasted a long time, while
Monsieur Mangeot persisted in whispering to his neighbors:</p>

<p>“I say, are we never going to dine? It’s after six;
I was very hungry, but you will see that my appetite will
have vanished when we sit down at the table.”</p>

<p>“Where is the famous bouquet you were going to
present to your father, young hidalgo?” Chambourdin
asked the son of the house.</p>

<p>“The bouquet? Oh! don’t mention it, my dear Chambourdin!
It was that infernal bouquet that caused the
accident to my trousers.”</p>

<p>“Did you undertake to pick the flowers yourself, pray?
Have you been flitting about the fields, my little shepherd?<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>”</p>

<p>“No; it’s a long story! There’s a flower girl&mdash;who is
very pretty&mdash;oh! I tell you she’s a beauty!”</p>

<p>“Enough, enough, you scamp! I don’t wish to know
any more;&mdash;but you may give me the flower girl’s address.”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville continued to talk with Madame
Glumeau and Mademoiselle Eolinde; but the rest
of the guests assumed that morose and surly air which
always invades a salon when dinner is delayed too long.
Some looked at the ceiling, others walked about the room,
concealing their yawns; this one consulted the clock at
every instant, another stretched himself out in an easy-chair
and tapped the floor impatiently. But at last the
door of the salon opened, and a servant appeared and
said:</p>

<p>“Madame is served.”</p>

<p>Instantly the scene changed; faces became amiable
once more, lips smiled; there was a general movement, a
murmur of satisfaction passed about the room, and stout
Dufournelle ran to offer his hand to the mistress of the
house, eager to escort her to the dining-room. But,
while accepting his proffered hand, Madame Glumeau
still hesitated; she wondered whether they ought to sit
down without her husband.&mdash;At that moment he appeared;
he walked proudly and quickly; he carried his
nose in the air and his foot gracefully arched; he was
not the same man who was squirming and making wry
faces a short time before. Madame Glumeau drew a long
breath and said to herself:<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a></p>

<p>“It seems that it did him good.”</p>

<p>Glumeau shot through his guests like an arrow and
offered his arm to the baroness, who accepted it. They
adjourned to the dining-room and took their seats at the
table in the order established by the cards. Madame de
Grangeville naturally was seated beside the host, and
Monsieur Camuzard was on her other side. Madame
Glumeau had seated Monsieur de Merval beside herself,
so that that gentleman was at some distance from the
baroness; not so far, however, that his eyes did not meet
hers from time to time; and, strange to say, at such times
Monsieur de Merval always lowered his first.</p>

<p>When their appetites were appeased sufficiently to
permit the guests to be agreeable, or at least to try to
appear so, the conversation became animated, and they
turned at last to the subject which had led to that festivity&mdash;the
performance to be given on Monsieur Glumeau’s
little stage in the country, and the distribution of parts.</p>

<p>“Unless something better is suggested, we propose to
give <i>La Forêt Périlleuse</i>,” said Madame Glumeau.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Chambourdin; “but in addition to
the speaking parts, we must have robbers, a band of
robbers.”</p>

<p>“We will find some,” said Glumeau; “robbers are not
what we lack.”</p>

<p>“The deuce! are they abundant in the neighborhood
of your country house?”</p>

<p>“Don’t joke, Chambourdin; if you do, nothing will
ever be decided, and we must arrange everything to-day;<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>
we go into the country next week, and we must give the
play at the end of June, no later.”</p>

<p>“Of course, with a theatre in the woods, we mustn’t
wait until the bad weather begins.”</p>

<p>“Well then, we will say <i>La Forêt Périlleuse</i>; my servants
and my gardener will be the robbers.”</p>

<p>“Oh! very good! excellent!”</p>

<p>“I will p&mdash;p&mdash;play the fair Ca&mdash;Ca&mdash;the fair Ca&mdash;Ca&mdash;Camille.”</p>

<p>“You are entitled to.”</p>

<p>“And my b&mdash;b&mdash;brother the robber chief.”</p>

<p>“Better and better&mdash;just as it used to be at Nicolet’s!”</p>

<p>“I say, I really believe Chambourdin is laughing at
us! What do the company think?”</p>

<p>“No indeed! but it’s lawful to laugh, isn’t it?” said
Chambourdin; “I don’t imagine that you are going to
act with sober faces all the time. Besides, am I not one
of your troupe? I will take whatever part you wish&mdash;a
robber, a tyrant, a victim. But allow me to make one
suggestion; instead of your <i>Forêt Périlleuse</i>, which is not
wonderfully clever, and in which there is only one female
part&mdash;and that one doesn’t come on in the first act&mdash;why
don’t you give <i>Roderic et Cunégonde</i>? That’s a splendid
parody on the fashionable melodrama, and full of wit
from end to end; indeed, it’s by the late Martainville,
who had wit to sell, so I have been told; for I never
knew him.”</p>

<p>Chambourdin’s suggestion was generally approved, except
by Mademoiselle Eolinde, who regretted the fair<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>
Camille; but they gave her the part of Cunégonde, which
was more in her line, because there are no long speeches
in it.</p>

<p>“But there’s a child in <i>Roderic et Cunégonde</i>,” said
Monsieur Mangeot.</p>

<p>“That’s all right! we’ll make one.”</p>

<p>“What do you say? you’ll make one?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, of pasteboard; with a doll; that’s simple
enough.”</p>

<p>“But the child has something to say.”</p>

<p>“That makes a difference; we will have one that can
talk; at a pinch I will play the child myself.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Monsieur Glumeau, “we’ll have my
gardener’s little one; he’s a very smart child.”</p>

<p>“Are there any other female parts?”</p>

<p>“There’s a peasant&mdash;little Colas; we’ll turn him into
a girl&mdash;little Colette.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; and Mademoiselle Polymnie will take
the part.”</p>

<p>“She would have made a little Colas quite as well!”
whispered Madame Dufournelle to Chambourdin, who
replied:</p>

<p>“Such things are thought, not said.”</p>

<p>“There’s one piece chosen,” said Mangeot, “so far so
good; but you are going to give something besides that,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course; we must have a very lively farce.”</p>

<p>“Have you made your selection? If not, I suggest
<i>Il y a plus d’un Ane à la Foire</i>.<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dufournelle, “that’s very amusing; we
saw it, didn’t we, Eléonore?&mdash;She laughed so much that
we came near having to leave the theatre.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that play,” said Monsieur Camuzard.
“Are there actually any asses in it?”</p>

<p>“There are three&mdash;but they’re dressed as men.”</p>

<p>“Ah! very good!”</p>

<p>And the old gentleman turned to the baroness and said:
“I don’t understand, do you, madame?”</p>

<p>The baroness looked at her neighbor with an ironical
expression, and replied:</p>

<p>“Have you never seen any, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Any what, madame?”</p>

<p>“Asses dressed as men.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so&mdash;that is to say&mdash;Ah! I see, it’s a
metaphor!&mdash;That’s a very unkind thing to say.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so, monsieur? I don’t.”</p>

<p>The play suggested was adopted; then they desired a
third, to begin the performance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Chambourdin, “when you take so much
trouble to put yourselves in training, you must give full
measure&mdash;a performance <i>complet</i>, like an omnibus. I
am going to propose a jolly farce, a little one-act affair
with three characters: <i>Œil et Nez</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Dufournelle; “do you remember,
Eléonore? when we saw it, you laughed so hard that&mdash;really
you laughed too heartily.”</p>

<p>“I had already suggested that,” said little Astianax;
“I know the part of Tityrus.<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a>”</p>

<p>“And I will be the Eye, if you choose,” laughed Madame
Dufournelle.</p>

<p>“And I the Nose,” said Chambourdin.</p>

<p>“But what on earth can this play be in which there’s
an Eye and a Nose?” queried Monsieur Camuzard, appealing
once more to his neighbor. “I can’t imagine,
can you, madame?”</p>

<p>“I, monsieur? Why I am accustomed to seeing them
in all the plays that are acted, and it doesn’t seem at all
strange to me.”</p>

<p>Far from satisfied with this reply, Monsieur Camuzard
dropped his chin on his cravat and his nose beneath his
spectacles.</p>

<p>The choice of plays being made, they sent out for
books, in order to distribute the rôles during the evening.
Then they left the table and returned to the salon,
where other guests, invited for the evening, were already
assembled.</p>

<p>In the confusion that takes place when a number of
people pass from one room to another, it is very easy
to approach a person to whom one has something to say.
A lover never lets that opportunity escape him, when he
has not been seated beside the lady of his thoughts at
dinner.</p>

<p>On this occasion it was a lady, who, as if without
design, seated herself in a corner of the salon where a
gentleman was already standing. The lady was the
Baronne de Grangeville, and she said to Monsieur de
Merval in an undertone:<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a></p>

<p>“Have I changed so very much, pray, that Monsieur de
Merval does not recognize me?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madame&mdash;I recognized you perfectly the
instant that you arrived.”</p>

<p>“In that case, why did you not speak to me?”</p>

<p>“You have changed your name and I supposed that
you did not wish to be recognized; I respected your
incognito.”</p>

<p>“If I have changed my name, you must be well
aware of the&mdash;the reason; you must have learned of
what&mdash;of what happened to me.”</p>

<p>“People say so many things in society, madame, that
one never knows what to believe, and in my opinion the
man who believes nothing is wisest.”</p>

<p>“Ah! monsieur, if one could foresee&mdash;could conceive
what would happen!”</p>

<p>“Why, there are some things that one can easily
foresee.”</p>

<p>The baroness cast a penetrating glance at Monsieur de
Merval, then rejoined:</p>

<p>“You are not married?”</p>

<p>“No, madame.”</p>

<p>“Faith, I am inclined to think that you have done as
well to abstain!&mdash;Will you not do me the pleasure to
come to see me?”</p>

<p>“You do me much honor, madame; and if it will not
be indiscreet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! not in the least; I am absolutely my own mistress.
We will talk of the past; that will not rejuvenate<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>
me, but it will give me pleasure. You will come, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I shall take advantage of your permission, madame.”</p>

<p>“Here is my card.”</p>

<p>Madame Dufournelle, who always knew what was
taking place in the salon, no matter where she happened
to be, whispered to her husband:</p>

<p>“The baroness seems to be talking with Monsieur de
Merval a great deal.”</p>

<p>“What of that? isn’t everybody here talking?”</p>

<p>“Yes, those who know one another.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they know each other.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me very much that way; she just put
something in his hand&mdash;something like a small piece of
paper. What can it be?”</p>

<p>“Instead of worrying about that, go and select a part;
they are just bringing the books.”</p>

<p>“A part. Oh! I mean to have a good one; I don’t
propose that they shall make me play a supernumerary,
or Monsieur Camuzard’s sweetheart&mdash;it’s so agreeable
when he speaks to you; he would kill a fly on the wing!
And it’s of no use to try to get away from it, for he has
a mania for talking into your face.”</p>

<p>“What do you expect, my dear love? everybody
hasn’t a perfumed breath.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I should think not! in fact, it’s a sad
thing to see how rapidly mankind is degenerating! But
there are people who seem to take pleasure in poisoning
one. Nowadays, three-fourths of the young men carry<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>
about an odor of tobacco, of pipes, of the barracks, that
turns the stomach of a person who doesn’t smoke; and
women, as a general rule, haven’t adopted that habit.”</p>

<p>“And then,” said Chambourdin, who had overheard
their conversation, “we have people with poor digestions&mdash;it’s
dangerous to speak to them after dinner. And
there are some too with decayed teeth; I can’t forgive
them, for they might go to a dentist, who would make
them inodorous. We also have ladies who lace too tight
and ruin their stomachs in that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh! really, monsieur, I don’t believe that!”</p>

<p>“I will procure you the testimony of physicians, madame,
to the effect that many ladies, married and unmarried,
have attempted to make their waists so slender,
have so squeezed their poor bodies, that the internal
organs have suffered, and foul breath has arrived after
some time. What madness! what idiocy! Ah! mesdames,
the most willowy, the most slender waist will
never be worth a fresh, pure breath, which is an indispensable
accompaniment of beauty!&mdash;Dufournelle, I trust
that we are going to have a little one?”</p>

<p>“A little what?”</p>

<p>“Parbleu! a little game of bouillotte&mdash;you and I and
Monsieur de Merval, and that little villain of a Miaulard,
who has just arrived sneezing; he always has a cold in
his head.”</p>

<p>“Oh! messieurs, you think of nothing in the world
but your cards; how nice it is of you, instead of playing
with us!<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>”</p>

<p>“Playing what?”</p>

<p>“Why, little games.”</p>

<p>“More or less innocent.&mdash;I’ll do it, on condition that
I am allowed to play blindman’s-buff sitting down, and
that the ladies guess who I am.&mdash;Ah! good! if that
unlucky Kingerie hasn’t upset a Carcel lamp, and Mademoiselle
Glumeau’s dress is covered with oil! That
youth is really very dangerous in company!”</p>

<p>“Oho! there’s a different sort of thing over yonder!
Just look at Mademoiselle Polymnie and Monsieur
Astianax playing battledore and shuttlecock, and seated,
at that!”</p>

<p>“Why, no, they’re going to play cup and ball; they
both have pointed sticks in their hands.”</p>

<p>“It’s a new kind of shuttlecock, monsieur: instead of
hitting it with a racquet, somebody, not long ago, invented
cornets to catch it in; but it’s a much prettier
way that they do it now: the shuttlecock has a hole at
the end, and you have to catch it by sticking the point into
the hole.”</p>

<p>“That’s a game that the ladies enjoy greatly; it is
immensely popular in salons.”</p>

<p>“But it must be rather hard.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Polymnie is very strong at it, they
say; she has asked young Kingerie to come to count the
strokes.”</p>

<p>“Thus far I haven’t seen him do anything but pick
up the shuttlecock, which the players don’t seem to catch
on their sticks.<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>”</p>

<p>And Chambourdin walked toward them, saying:</p>

<p>“Oh! what a pretty game! I am sorry that I didn’t
see the beginning. How many times have they caught it
in succession, Monsieur Kingerie?”</p>

<p>“Once!” the young man replied, as he stooped again
to pick up the shuttlecock.</p>

<p>Many more guests arrived, and as the salon was
crowded, Mademoiselle Polymnie and her adversary were
obliged to abandon their game, evidently to the intense
dissatisfaction of the young lady.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” she said; “we were beginning to play
so well!”</p>

<p>“How does she succeed, I wonder, when she plays
badly!” said Madame Dufournelle laughingly.</p>

<p>But the master of the house, having no pain in his
stomach, insisted that they must dance. The bouillotte
players were removed to an adjoining room, and an
amateur took his place at the piano and played a polka,
then a redowa, then a mazurka; for the quadrille is sadly
neglected now; it is abandoned for new-fangled dances,
which the dancers do not know in most cases, and which,
consequently, they dance very poorly. The old-fashioned
quadrille ventures to show its head only at long intervals
nowadays, and it is treated with a discourtesy which will
end by banishing it altogether.</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau took possession of a young lady of
fourteen, with whom he danced the polka, redowa and
mazurka without removing his eyes for a moment from
his feet, which, however, was not likely to distress his<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>
partner. And Madame Glumeau, proud of the agility displayed
by her husband, exclaimed in an outburst of enthusiasm:</p>

<p>“Ah! what a good thing it was that he took it!”</p>

<p>“What? a dancing-master?” queried Monsieur Camuzard.
But Madame Glumeau turned away without replying
and requested Monsieur Kingerie to leave the
piano, as he had already broken several strings.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock Madame de Grangeville vanished
from the salon, after looking about in vain for Monsieur
de Merval. But he had departed some time before, and
the elegant baroness, who had counted upon a gentleman
to escort her home, entered her cab all alone, frowning
and muttering:</p>

<p>“Ah! men aren’t so agreeable as they used to be!”</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br /><br />
<small>THE GOUTY GENTLEMAN</small></h2>

<p>The gouty gentleman had followed the boulevards,
walking toward the small theatres; when I say small
theatres, I do it in accordance with an old habit, which
it would be well to lay aside. Indeed, there are on Boulevard
du Temple theatres which are very far from being
small; and then too, even at the small ones sometimes<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>
they give works which are much superior to those which
are played at the large ones.</p>

<p>The gentleman turned into Rue Charlot, in the heart
of the Marais, walking very slowly, because of his lame
foot, and also because he never failed to stop and turn
around whenever a pretty face passed; which caused
Chicotin to say:</p>

<p>“This old boy seems to be a connoisseur! I ought to
have let myself out by the hour, and I should have made
a handsome thing of it!”</p>

<p>The gentleman finally stopped in front of a small furnished
lodging house, of very modest appearance, on
Rue de Bretagne. He turned to the messenger and said
with a smile:</p>

<p>“Here we are, this is my hotel. It doesn’t come up
to Hôtel Meurice, or even to Hôtel des Ambassadeurs!
Other times, other hotels.&mdash;Follow me.”</p>

<p>Chicotin followed the gentleman, who went up to the
third floor and entered a room comfortably furnished,
but without taste or style or harmony; the bed was
mahogany, the bureau oak, and the chairs walnut; the
bed curtains were modern in style; but there were curtains
at the windows which were suitable for a peasant’s
cottage at best; in short, all the articles of furniture
seemed to swear at finding themselves together, and the
occupant of the room also made a wry face at finding
himself surrounded by such things.</p>

<p>He threw himself down on a sort of couch, on which
castors had been put to give it some resemblance to an<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>
easy-chair <i>à la Voltaire</i>, and said to the young messenger
who had remained in the middle of the room:</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say to this? It is magnificent,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Chicotin shook his head as he replied:</p>

<p>“Well! it isn’t bad, but I’ve seen better.”</p>

<p>“Good! I am very glad to see that you know a thing
or two! The fact is that this house is furnished in the
most wretched fashion! I have no idea where they could
have picked up all this stuff; a second-hand dealer would
never recognize himself here; and when one has lived a
long while at the Hôtel Meurice, one finds a terrible difference!
But still one resigns oneself to it, when one cannot
do otherwise. Wait while I write a line; then you will
carry my letter and this bouquet. Just pull that bell
over there.”</p>

<p>Chicotin pulled the bell; a maid-servant, covered with
a layer of dust from top to toe, answered the summons
and said:</p>

<p>“What does monsieur want?”</p>

<p>“Light to seal a letter, for there is nothing here! not
a candle on the mantelpiece, no sealing wax on this desk&mdash;if
that’s what you call it.”</p>

<p>“But there’s wafers in the box where the night light is.
Look, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to take all that away! Do
you suppose that I would touch that filthy box? Do you
suppose that I use wafers? I tell you that I want wax,
a seal and a candle. Come, make haste.<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>”</p>

<p>The girl left the room grumbling. The gentleman
moved his chair to the desk and began to write, swearing
at the paper, the pens and the sand.</p>

<p>The maid returned, bringing a copper candlestick, with
a tallow candle lighted, and a stick of wax, which she
placed on the desk.</p>

<p>“As for a seal,” she said, “madame says that she ain’t
got any, but that a big sou will do just as well.”</p>

<p>“What’s this you have brought me?” cried the gentleman,
pushing the candle away in disgust. “Ah! what
an outrage!”</p>

<p>“What’s that? an outrage! I’ve brought what you
ordered.”</p>

<p>“You dare to bring me a tallow candle&mdash;for this certainly
is tallow, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s a tallow candle, as you want to use
sealing wax.”</p>

<p>“But a wax candle is what you ought to bring; as if
one could use anything else! Since when has it been permissible
to offer tenants a tallow candle? What do you
take me for, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Your dear! Why, monsieur, I take you&mdash;I mean I
don’t take you at all; I bring you the best that I could
find; there ain’t no wax candle that’s been used, and
madame said that this was good enough to light your
wax.”</p>

<p>“And this place dares to call itself a hotel! There are
furnished lodgings for masons here, and nothing else!”</p>

<p>“On my word, monsieur!<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>”</p>

<p>“Take that candle away, I say. Pouah! how it smells!
Let’s make haste.”</p>

<p>He sealed his letter, using a topaz set in a ring, which
he wore as a charm on his watch chain; then he dismissed
the maid, who muttered as she left the room:</p>

<p>“What airs he puts on! If he was a pacha, he couldn’t
put on any more. Why don’t he have a hotel of his
own?”</p>

<p>“Here, my boy,” said the gentleman, when he had
written the address on his letter, “take this note and this
bouquet, which I stole from those gentlemen for the
pleasure of playing a trick on them, for I hadn’t the
slightest idea of buying a bouquet. But since I have it,
I must make some use of it, and I am not sorry to show
myself a gallant once more. So you will carry this bouquet
and this letter to this address. Can you read?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, a little&mdash;print; but as for hand-writing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say at once that you don’t know how
to read?&mdash;Well, you are to go to Madame la Baronne de
Grangeville; she lives, or at all events she did live, twelve
years ago, at 27 Rue de Provence. If by any chance she
has moved, ask the concierge for her new address and
take the things there. If you are not an idiot, you will
succeed in finding the lady. If she is visible, you will
wait for a reply; if not, you will leave both with her
maid, and come back here, where I will pay you; I
forbid you to take anything elsewhere. Do you understand?<a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“You remember the lady’s name?”</p>

<p>“Baronne de Grangeville, 27 Rue de Provence.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; now be off, and hurry back.&mdash;By the
way, if before admitting you, they should ask you from
whom you come, you will reply that you come from
Monsieur de Roncherolle.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Roncherolle; very good, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Chicotin took his leave. Thereupon, Monsieur de
Roncherolle,&mdash;for now we know that that was the gouty
gentleman’s name,&mdash;placed his diseased foot on one of
the chairs covered with cotton, then stretched himself
in the easy-chair, rested his head against the back, and
with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, reflected thus:</p>

<p>“Dear Lucienne! I am sure that she will be delighted
to see me again; and for my part it will give me pleasure
to be in her company once more. It is fully twelve years
since we met! Twelve years! This infernal time flies
with terrifying rapidity, on my word! it seems to me that
it was only yesterday; and yet a good many things have
happened in the interval! Ah! I hadn’t the gout then,
and my sufferings were very much less. To grow old
and to suffer&mdash;all varieties of annoyance at once! But
that is the common law, and as the inimitable Potier says
in <i>Le Chiffonier</i>: ‘When a man is not satisfied, he must
be a philosopher!’&mdash;She was very pretty, was Lucienne!
Yes, she was one of the prettiest women in Paris! and
I was one of the handsomest gallants of my time; indeed,
if it weren’t for this infernal gout, I should still be very<a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>
presentable!&mdash;Ow! There was a twinge, I wonder if I
am going to have another attack? If so, it would be
rather hard for me to go to present my respects to the
baroness, as I have asked permission to do in my note.
But let me see; as I think it over, it seems to me that
Lucienne and I parted on rather bad terms, yes, very
bad; she became jealous; what nonsense! she should
know better than anyone that jealousy doesn’t keep one
from being deceived! But twelve years have passed since
that, and there is no better refrigerant than time. The
poor baroness must have become reasonable by now; we
don’t look at those things from the same point of view
at forty as at thirty&mdash;if she isn’t forty, she can’t be far
from it.&mdash;It’s a pity! Women ought never to grow old,
nor men either; children are the only ones who ought to
grow, and they should stop when they reach maturity.&mdash;Ah!
there’s a twinge; and yet I am leading the life
of an anchorite: no champagne, no truffles! To be sure,
the funds are low, very low, in fact. I expected to break
the bank at Baden-Baden: I had discovered a very ingenious
<i>martingale</i>, an infallible method of winning at
roulette; I don’t understand how it happened that it
was my pocket that was broken! Ah! if I were not short
of money, how quickly I would send this dieting business
to the devil! and then if I had the gout, there would be
some reason for it. They say that it is due to my past
excesses; I don’t believe a word of it, for I should have
had it sooner!&mdash;And he&mdash;what has become of him, I
wonder, of that dear friend of mine, who was absolutely<a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>
determined to kill me? In the six weeks since I came
back to Paris, it is probable that I should have come face
to face with him on the street, if the gout had not kept
me in this hotel, in this barrack. But still, it is so long
ago, perhaps he is dead. On my honor, I should be
very sorry to learn it! I should feel it badly. If
he is dead, the baroness must know it.&mdash;How gloomy it
is here! What a wretched neighborhood! One doesn’t
even hear the noise of carriages&mdash;I believe, God forgive
me, that no carriages pass here. Ah! I will not stay
here. I would rather have a room under the eaves in the
dear old Bréda quarter! The only thing one can do
here is to sleep! and as my gout permits it, I will take a
nap, while I await the return of my messenger. He has
a mighty cunning air, that fellow; he reminds me of a
little Norman whom I employed in 1830, or thereabouts,
and whom I surprised one day throwing oil on my
trousers and coat, because I usually made him a present
of my clothes as soon as they had any spots on them.”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Roncherolle fell asleep, dreaming of his
past. It is what a man usually does who is on the decline,
whereas in youth he dreams of the future.</p>

<p>Chicotin’s shrill voice woke the ex-gallant abruptly,
and he opened his eyes, muttering:</p>

<p>“Who is the rascal who dares to enter my room without
ringing? Ten thousand devils! I was dreaming that
I was at Baden-Baden again. Alas! I must return to the
sad reality.&mdash;It’s you, is it, my boy? Well, what reply
to your message?<a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a>”</p>

<p>“Here it is, monsieur.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Chicotin held out the note and the bouquet,
which he still had in his hands.</p>

<p>“What! you have brought them both back? She
refused my bouquet and my letter?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, monsieur, the lady did not refuse anything,
because I didn’t find her; she has moved!”</p>

<p>“Pardieu! I thought you were cleverer than this, my
boy! Because a person has changed her lodgings, you
can’t find her! There’s a sharp messenger for you!”</p>

<p>“I am no more stupid than others, monsieur, and you
will see if it’s my fault. I went to Rue de Provence, to
the number you gave me; a fine house, good style. I
asked the concierge, who has a lodge furnished better
than this room, for Madame la Baronne de Grangeville.
He opened his eyes, looked at his wife who was sipping
coffee from a silver cup, and said to her: ‘The Baronne
de Grangeville&mdash;do you know her, wife?’ and his wife
drank her coffee first and then answered: ‘We haven’t
got anybody here of that name.’&mdash;‘But,’ I said to her,
‘that lady did live in this house; the gentleman who sent
me is certain of it; if she’s moved, she must have left
her address. Give me that and I will go away.’&mdash;‘How
long ago did this baroness live here?’ asked the concierge.&mdash;‘Twelve
years,’ I said.&mdash;At that the husband and
wife began to laugh, and said to me: ‘In twelve years
a lot of water has flowed under the bridge, my boy. It’s
seven years now since we took the place of the former
concierge, who died here, and we never heard the name<a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>
of your baroness. If the other concierge was alive, perhaps
he might know her address. But he’s at Montmartre,
you know where; perhaps you’ll go there and
ask him.’ Faith, monsieur, I thought it wasn’t worth
while to go to Montmartre, so I came back with your
letter and your bouquet. Do you still think that it’s my
fault?”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Roncherolle took the articles which
Chicotin handed him. He tore up the letter, muttering:</p>

<p>“No, so long as you didn’t find the scent. Hum!
more of the ill effects of time. I come back, and I find
nobody left: some are dead; others have disappeared.
Ah! it’s foolish to travel; or if one must travel, one
should do like the Wandering Jew: keep going all the
time, and never stop. But the Wandering Jew didn’t
have the gout.&mdash;Here, my boy, this is for your commission.”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Roncherolle paid the messenger handsomely,
because the man who has always borne himself
like a gentleman retains the habit of making a show of
generosity, even when his means allow him no longer to
be generous; and sometimes imposes great privations
upon himself in order to enjoy the pleasure of throwing
money out of the window.</p>

<p>“Then monsieur has no further need of my services?”
said Chicotin, his appetite whetted by the fee he had received
for his errand.</p>

<p>“Faith, my boy, I should have been very glad to find
the lady to whom I wrote the letter. It isn’t certain that<a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>
she’s dead, like the concierge of the house where she
lived, for she was quite young a dozen years ago, and
she should be a woman of about forty now. If chance
should make you acquainted with her present residence,
come at once and tell me, and you shall have a good
pourboire.”</p>

<p>“All right, master. I’ll look, I’ll ask questions, and
I shall end by finding her. I go into every corner of
Paris, you know; but perhaps it will take rather a long
time. However, as soon as I find out anything, I’ll come
to tell you.”</p>

<p>When Chicotin had gone, Monsieur de Roncherolle,
whose face had assumed a melancholy expression, looked
at the bouquet which he still held, muttering:</p>

<p>“Well, I will keep the bouquet; these flowers are very
pretty; it’s a long while since anyone gave me any; I
will imagine that someone has sent them to me; I have
reached the age where I must live on illusions.<a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br /><br />
<small>THE MOTHER AND THE SON</small></h2>

<p>Georget passed several days scouring Paris; but he
made the most minute investigations in the Chaussée-d’Antin
quarter; he asked for Monsieur de Roncherolle
in all the fine hotels, and received everywhere the answer
that no person of that name had apartments there. Then
the young messenger would return in the afternoon to
Boulevard du Château d’Eau, to say good-evening to
Violette, to whom he would confide the ill success of his
efforts; and before going home he would try to find
work to do in order to earn a little money. Georget no
longer passed the day loafing on the boulevard as before;
he no longer passed the time with his friend Chicotin,
who, if he had known why Georget was exploring Paris,
could have put an end to his search with a word. Chicotin,
on his side, was looking for the Baronne de Grangeville,
but without fatiguing himself overmuch and without
exhibiting as much zeal as his friend in his inquiries.
And when night came, instead of returning to the neighborhood
of the Château d’Eau, Monsieur Patatras, as he
adored the play, hung about in the neighborhood of the
people who were on their way to the theatres on Boulevard
du Temple, and his felicity was complete when,<a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>
toward the close of the evening, he succeeded in obtaining
a check, by means of which he witnessed the last act
of a melodrama or a farce.</p>

<p>Every morning before starting out, Georget deemed it
his duty to go to Monsieur Malberg, to tell him what
quarter and what streets he had explored the day before.
Although the result of his investigations was not as yet
satisfactory, he was desirous to prove to the man who
had assisted him so generously that his zeal had not
abated. The young messenger was rarely admitted to
Monsieur Malberg’s presence, but he always found
Pongo deep in conversation with the furniture; then he
would tell the mulatto what he had done, and he never
failed to report faithfully to his master all that Georget
had told him.</p>

<p>The perseverance which the young man displayed in
demonstrating his gratitude, ended by touching the heart
of the gentleman on the third floor, who told his servant
one morning to admit Georget when he called; and that
order had scarcely been given when the young man appeared
as usual to tell what he had done the day before.</p>

<p>Pongo immediately suspended the toilet of a kitten
which he had picked up the night before in the street,
to usher Georget into his master’s presence; then he
left the room, saying:</p>

<p>“Now me breakfast with my new friend Carabi, that
me found yesterday under a door, all alone and crying.
Nothing to eat this long time, very thin, very unhappy;
but me bring him here, me take him to bed with me, feed<a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>
him, and this morning he all right, all happy; he purr
and hump his back at me.”</p>

<p>“Come in, my friend,” said Monsieur Malberg to
Georget, who stood timidly in the doorway; “come in
and sit down.”</p>

<p>“Oh! monsieur is too kind; but I am not tired, and
then I cannot presume to sit down in monsieur’s presence.”</p>

<p>“I tell you that I want you to sit down; I have something
to say to you. Take this chair.”</p>

<p>Georget obeyed, and took his seat on the edge of a
chair; then he made haste to say:</p>

<p>“I went to the Palais-Royal quarter yesterday, monsieur;
I went the whole length of Rue Richelieu, Rue
Neuve-des-Petits-Champs and all the streets leading into
them. There are many hotels in that quarter, and yet I
discovered nothing; no one there knows that gentleman.”</p>

<p>“My boy, it is eight or ten days now, I believe, that
you have been engaged in this tiresome business for me!
That is quite enough! Cease your investigations; you
have more than earned the money which you pretend that
you owe me.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, it doesn’t tire me at all to go about
Paris; besides, it’s my trade, and I often do other errands
while I am looking for monsieur; so why shouldn’t I keep
on? I haven’t searched all Paris yet.”</p>

<p>“I tell you again, my friend, that I don’t want you
to look any farther. I have reflected, and if heaven permits
me to find this gentleman, whom you have sought in<a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>
vain, it will bring me face to face with him; otherwise,
it evidently means that He who governs everything does
not choose that I should carry out my plans, and I must
submit.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps monsieur is not satisfied with me; perhaps
he thinks that I do not go about it in the right way,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am entirely satisfied with you;
your mother, whom I have seen, because she absolutely
insisted upon thanking me,&mdash;your mother has no end of
pleasant things to say about you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you mustn’t believe it all, monsieur; mothers
exaggerate a bit, you know, when they talk about their
sons!”</p>

<p>“That may be, but other persons too have confirmed
what your mother said.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is too kind!”</p>

<p>“You have had some education; you know how to
read and write and figure, do you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, tolerably well.”</p>

<p>“Listen, this is what I have to propose. I have quite
a large estate at Nogent-sur-Marne; there are eight
acres of orchard, kitchen garden and woods; but it is
wretchedly cared for and kept up by a gardener who is
very lazy, and who, having no one to watch him, fancies
himself the owner of the property and does only what
he pleases; for I rarely go there, and even in the summer
I pass only a few weeks there; but if the house were well
kept up and the garden taken care of, I should enjoy it<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>
much more. Well, I suggest that you and your mother
go to live on that estate; your duty will be, not to work
in the garden, but to oversee and direct the work, the
planting, and the improvements. Oh! you will have
plenty to do! Eight acres of ground&mdash;there is room for
lots of things in that. There are also repairs to be made
on the buildings. I give you full power; you will take
my place, and you will be obeyed as I should be. As
for your mother, she will look after the house, the dairy,
the poultry yard, which is well stocked; and then, when
I take a fancy to visit my estate, I shall be certain at least
of finding a room in condition to receive me and lodge me.
I offer you for this a thousand francs a year, and of
course you will have your lodgings and fuel, and as much
as you want of fruit, vegetables, rabbits and all the
occupants of a poultry yard. Now if this is satisfactory
to you and to your mother, you may go down and install
yourselves there to-morrow, and I will undertake to pay
what you owe the landlord here.”</p>

<p>While Monsieur Malberg was speaking, Georget, listening
intently, changed color several times; sometimes he
enjoyed the thought of the pleasant and happy life which
was offered him; sometimes his brow became clouded
and thoughtful; and it was plain that a bitter conflict was
going on in his heart. When Monsieur Malberg ceased
to speak, the poor boy said not a word, but seemed afraid
to reply.</p>

<p>“Well, Georget, you say nothing; does that mean that
you do not understand my proposal?<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>”</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg pardon, monsieur; I understand perfectly
all that you offer to do for us; what a peaceful and happy
life you offer us; to live on a pleasant estate in the
country, to have duties which are only pleasures, and
to be paid for it all! Oh! that is too much good fortune.
And my poor mother, who is so fond of the country and
of gardens! Ah! how happy she would be there!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you accept, Georget?”</p>

<p>The young man lowered his eyes; and soon two great
tears escaped from them; he hid his face behind his
handkerchief, stammering:</p>

<p>“No, monsieur&mdash;I&mdash;I decline.”</p>

<p>“You decline what would be, you say, a happy life for
you, and would give your mother so much pleasure! I
can’t understand you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, I decline. Oh! I know very well
that what I am doing is wrong! It is a horrible thing
on my part to refuse what would certainly give my
mother rest and happiness! It is outrageous, it is a
wicked thing for me to do! But it is too much for me,
monsieur! You won’t tell mother, I implore you, monsieur&mdash;will
you? You won’t tell her that you offered
me all this and I refused? It would make her unhappy
and perhaps she wouldn’t forgive me!”</p>

<p>And poor Georget knelt at Monsieur Malberg’s feet,
repeating: “I beg you, monsieur, don’t say anything to
my mother!”</p>

<p>“Rise, Georget, rise; no, of course I won’t say anything
to your mother. Indeed, you must have powerful<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>
reasons for acting thus! Don’t weep, my friend, I do
not wish to cause you pain; once more I say, forget
my offer and let us not mention the subject again.”</p>

<p>“Forget it! Oh, no! I know very well that I shall not
forget it, monsieur! It was so kind of you! As to my
reasons&mdash;my reasons for declining, I haven’t got but one,
but I don’t dare to tell you what it is.”</p>

<p>“Keep your secret; I don’t ask any questions.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to think of me as a bad son,
as a fellow who prefers the life of a vagabond in Paris
to his mother’s happiness, monsieur. No; I would rather
tell you everything. I am in love, monsieur; yes, madly
in love with a young flower girl at the Château d’Eau,
on the boulevard yonder. Violette is so pretty, and a
respectable, virtuous girl, who doesn’t listen to anybody!”</p>

<p>“But she listens to you, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, for I have never dared to tell her outright
that I am in love with her; she may have seen it,
but she doesn’t act as if she had. But, monsieur, I can
see her every morning when I go out, and at night before
I come home, for I always find an excuse to pass by her
stand. But if I should go and live on your place in the
country, then I should have to give up seeing Violette,
in the morning or at night or ever! and you see, monsieur,
I feel that it would be impossible for me to live
without seeing her! It would be like not living at all;
and then it seems to me that I shouldn’t be good for anything.<a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>”</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” murmured Monsieur Malberg; “so
young, and in love already! If he is happy, I shall be
very much surprised.”</p>

<p>“It’s very bad of me to do as I am doing, isn’t it,
monsieur? On account of this love that turns my head,
for this girl who perhaps doesn’t love me and will never
love me, I refuse to assure my mother a peaceful life and
livelihood. Ah! I feel that I am an ungrateful, wicked
son! I hate myself, I would beat myself if it would do
any good; but it wouldn’t cure me! This love has crept
into my heart little by little; it’s more than three years
now that I have seen Violette almost every day; I was
very young at first, and then as I grew up I got used
to loving her, and that sentiment grew up with me, and
grew much faster than I did. So now there is no way
to drive it from my heart; it can never leave it; and indeed
if it could, I wouldn’t want it to. Could I ever
guess that the day would come when it would cause me
so much sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Don’t despair, Georget; it may be that there is still
some way of arranging matters. Suggest to your mother
to go and live on my estate and take care of my house;
don’t tell her that there was a place there for you too;
in this way your mother will be able to live in the
country where you say she enjoys herself so much, and
you can go to see her whenever you please; it is not
far from here to Nogent,&mdash;three leagues at most.”</p>

<p>“Ah! how kind you are, monsieur! In that way, as
you say, my mother will live comfortably, and the fresh<a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>
country air will cure her entirely. It is true that it will
be hard for me not to see her every day, not to live with
her; but I shall be able to endure that privation, because
I will say to myself: ‘It’s for her good, it’s for her happiness!’
but still it isn’t kind of me to think that I could
get along without seeing mother and that I can’t make up
my mind not to see Violette; is it, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t your fault, my boy; nature has decreed that
a new love is always fatal to the old ones.”</p>

<p>“But one’s love for one’s mother, monsieur! that
ought not to grow any less in our hearts; but it is less
unreasonable than the other. Ah! if you knew Violette,
monsieur, you would understand that I cannot cease to
love her. She is so pretty! She has her stand on the
boulevard, near the Château d’Eau; would you like me
to tell her to bring you a bouquet? She would ask nothing
better, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t necessary; I have no need of bouquets,
and I take your word for all that you say of this girl.”</p>

<p>“Then, monsieur, with your permission, I will go
right away and tell my mother what you are kind enough
to offer her.”</p>

<p>“Go, Georget, and come back and tell me her answer.”</p>

<p>“Happy age,” said Monsieur Malberg to himself as he
watched the young messenger walk away; “happy age,
when one does not doubt constancy in love, when one
believes in the sincerity of friendship! I, too, believed in
those things, but I was most cruelly undeceived! He
sacrifices everything to his love for a woman! Poor boy!<a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a>
he will be deceived like the others; but he begins that
trade too early!”</p>

<p>And Monsieur Malberg, whose brow had darkened, relapsed
into profound meditation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his servant Pongo had a sharp altercation
with the cat which he had named Carabi, and which, in
payment for the hospitality that had been bestowed upon
him, had savagely clawed his benefactor.</p>

<p>“Ah! you naughty, Carabi,” said the mulatto, holding
the cat by his two forepaws; “you hurt me, when me
pick you up in the street; and you not handsome either;
but thin, ugly, little short hair; you a gutter cat, you
hear? You no angora, you gutter cat! and me take care
of you, comb you and rub you, make nice porridge for
you, so’s to make you pretty and fat; and you claw me on
the nose when me try to talk with you, like two friends.
You take care, Carabi! if me take Mamzelle Zima to beat
you, Mamzelle Zima, she mind me right off, and she
strike hard, Mamzelle Zima; will you be good boy now?”</p>

<p>The cat’s only reply was to howl in a piteous fashion;
and he was beginning to vary his cries with snarls which
boded no good to Pongo, when Georget returned and
interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p>“Ah! little neighbor again! He want to speak to
master or me?”</p>

<p>“I have come to bring your master my mother’s reply.
He is very good&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! he not good; but me beat him, me whip him
if he claw again!<a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>”</p>

<p>“I am speaking of your master.”</p>

<p>“Oh! me tink it was my new friend Carabi; he claw
my nose. Come, you go in right away.&mdash;Little gutter
cat! you wait there till me come back. Don’t stir, or me
take Zima!”</p>

<p>When he reappeared before Monsieur Malberg, Georget
was sad, and seemed embarrassed; he kept his eyes
on the floor, and dared not speak.</p>

<p>“Well, Georget, you have come to bring me your
mother’s answer,” said Monsieur Malberg; “but to look
at you one would think that you dared not tell me what
it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah! monsieur, you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! I will spare you the trouble of telling
me, for I will wager that I can guess what your mother
answered: she refused my offer, because she would have
to part with you, and she prefers to live in poverty and
not leave her son; isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, yes, that’s the truth; when I told
her about monsieur’s offer, she was struck dumb at first;
and when she did answer, I heard her voice trembling
as if she were going to cry, when she said: ‘Well! if
you want me to go away, if it bores you to live with
your mother, why then I will go to this fine place in the
country; but for my part, I should much prefer to live
on a little, to be less comfortable, and to be where I
could embrace my son every day; that would make me
much happier!’&mdash;So then, monsieur, as you can imagine,
I threw my arms about my mother’s neck and said to her:<a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>
‘It was in the hope of assuring your happiness that I
offered you this; if you are happier with me, you must
stay here, and I shall be happier too!’&mdash;Then she told
me to come and thank you for your kindness, monsieur,
and explain the reason for her refusal, and I beg you to
forgive me for showing so little appreciation of your
kindness; for in all this it is I who am most to blame.
If I had had the courage to leave Paris, why, then my
mother would have been very glad to go!”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, Georget, but I hope that your
flower girl is worthy of the sacrifice you are making for
her. Go, my boy.”</p>

<p>“And monsieur doesn’t want Violette to bring him a
bouquet, so that&mdash;so that he can make her acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want any bouquet.”</p>

<p>“And I am not to look for Monsieur de Roncherolle
any more?”</p>

<p>“It’s no use.”</p>

<p>“But monsieur will still employ me when he needs a
messenger?”</p>

<p>“That goes without saying. Now go.”</p>

<p>Georget went away in a sad frame of mind, for at the
bottom of his heart he was not content with himself. As
he passed through the reception room, he made no reply
when Pongo called out to him:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Georget, Carabi not so bad now, he no claw
nothing but my ear.<a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br /><br />
A TRAP</h2>

<p>To Georget’s mind, the best way to find an excuse for
his wrongdoing was to go to her who was the cause of
his committing it; so that was what he did not fail to
do; and as he looked at the fascinating flower girl, he
said to himself:</p>

<p>“As if it would have been possible for me to live
without seeing her! Oh, no! I should have died of grief,
and that would have made my mother more unhappy than
all the rest! So I did well not to accept Monsieur Malberg’s
offer.”</p>

<p>Thus it is that man always finds a way to compromise
with his conscience and to put himself on pleasant terms
with it.</p>

<p>Violette smiled pleasantly at Georget, saying:</p>

<p>“So you’re not travelling all over Paris to-day, Georget?”</p>

<p>“No, mamzelle, my travels are ended; Monsieur Malberg
doesn’t want me to go on looking for his man.&mdash;But
what has become of Chicotin? I never see him here
now.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, he doesn’t come so much as he did. I
am not sorry, for he frequently knocked my customers
down, and that would have ended by injuring my trade.<a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>”</p>

<p>“Your customers! You mean the fine gentlemen who
come here to make sweet speeches to you! Do you still
see those fellows?”</p>

<p>“Dear me! when it pleases them to buy flowers of me
I can’t refuse to sell them.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if I was rich, Mamzelle Violette, you wouldn’t
sell anything at all, you would have a home of your own,
and a lovely room, with nothing else to do but arrange
your hair!”</p>

<p>“Really, Georget, you would give me all that?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would, and much more too if I had it!”</p>

<p>“Do you think that I would accept it from you rather
than from another man?”</p>

<p>“Why, mamzelle, when a man has only honorable
sentiments; you may be sure that I wouldn’t offer that
to you as a mistress, but as&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;Oh! Violette, you
understand me well enough, but you are not willing to
help me a little!”</p>

<p>“No, Georget, I do not choose to understand you, because
I don’t choose to take seriously the foolish things
that you say to me.”</p>

<p>“Foolish things! oh! you are mistaken, mamzelle;
and if you knew,&mdash;if you could guess&mdash;you would no
longer doubt my love! Yes, Violette, I love you. I
must pluck up courage to tell you, if you refuse to believe
it; I love you to the point of&mdash;but I mustn’t tell
you that.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Come, Georget, finish. You say nothing?
Poor boy! you imagine that you love me; but in<a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>
a month, in less than that perhaps, you will have something
else in your mind. You are a child, do you know!
A boy should never talk of love until he’s twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“Oh! mon Dieu! how I would like to grow old! So
you don’t believe me, mamzelle?”</p>

<p>“I say again that it’s very possible that you believe
what you say now; but it won’t be so for long,&mdash;you are
too young.”</p>

<p>“Too young, that is the only thing you can throw
in my face. What proofs do you want to make you
believe in my love?”</p>

<p>“See, Georget, look at that little bit of a man passing
over there, who looks at me in such a funny way.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I recognize him; it’s the little squint-eyed fellow.
I had an idea that that creature was in love with
you too; but I am not jealous of him! he’s too ugly!
Why do you point him out to me? I wasn’t talking about
him, mamzelle.”</p>

<p>“I pointed him out to you, Georget, because that little
fellow, who can hardly be any older than you, a year at
most, has been prowling about here all the time for several
days; he constantly bargains for flowers with me, and
then he too has told me that he adores me, and has suggested
carrying me off and taking me to Saint-Germain
or to Versailles, or even farther, declaring that he would
make me happy.”</p>

<p>“What! that little wretch has told you all that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that little fellow has told me all those foolish
things; and I laughed in his face&mdash;that was the best<a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>
thing for me to do. Since then, he has ceased to speak
to me, but he comes here just as often and hurls savage
glances at me&mdash;look, as he is doing now.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if he treats you discourteously, I’ll go and say a
word to him.”</p>

<p>“No, Georget, he’s not discourteous, for he doesn’t
speak; we can’t prevent his walking here; and besides,
I am always tempted to laugh when I look at him, remembering
that one day Chicotin knocked him down in
such a way that he tore both knees of his trousers.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how I would have liked to see that! There he
goes away; he has made up his mind it’s no use, and he
has done well.”</p>

<p>“Well, Georget, if I had listened to what that young
man said, do you think that I should have done right?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! of course not!”</p>

<p>“So then you see that I should be no more reasonable
if I should listen to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what a difference, Violette! You compare my
love with that of that little popinjay who hardly knows
you! Whereas I have seen you and loved you for three
years! So I am nothing more to you than the first comer
who pays you compliments as he buys your bouquets!
Ah! it isn’t right to treat me so. You wouldn’t act like
this if you knew&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What? if I knew what? Ah! you tire me, constantly
beginning sentences which you don’t finish!”</p>

<p>Georget had on the end of his lips the avowal of the
sacrifice he had made to his love for Violette; for in<a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>
youth, one has not become accustomed to sacrifices, and
it is natural to boast of them. However, the young lover
retained that secret which was on the point of escaping
him; he suspected that the pretty flower girl would scold
him roundly for having acted so, and that, far from approving
his conduct, she would try to compel him to
accept Monsieur Malberg’s offer; so he deemed it prudent
to hold his peace, and he did not answer Violette’s
questions. At that moment someone came up who wanted
Georget to run on an errand, and he seized that opportunity
to take his leave, waving his hand as an adieu to
the flower girl.</p>

<p>The pretty peddler was more moved than she had
chosen to appear. Georget was such a dear fellow! It
was the first time that he had told her in so many words
that he loved her, and he had made that declaration in
such a sweet voice, with such an affectionate expression,
that it was difficult not to believe in his sincerity, and
further, not to be touched by that genuine love, in which
passion was so artlessly expressed.</p>

<p>While giving her young lover sage advice, and while
pretending to laugh at his suffering, Violette had nevertheless
felt a very keen sensation; her heart had opened
to a happiness that she had not as yet known, and she
was herself amazed by the unfamiliar joy which filled
her whole being.</p>

<p>About an hour had passed since Georget had gone
away, when a sort of servant approached Violette and
said to her:<a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle la bouquetière, I want a fine bouquet
for my mistress, Madame de Belleval; all the rarest
flowers that you have; the price does not matter. I will
give you a hundred sous in advance, and if that isn’t
enough, she will give you the rest.”</p>

<p>“That will be enough, monsieur; for a hundred sous
I will make you a superb bouquet!”</p>

<p>“But, mademoiselle, you must have the kindness to
carry it to madame yourself, for I am in a great hurry;
I haven’t time to wait, and I shan’t come back this way.”</p>

<p>“I am to carry the bouquet? Is it far from here?”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle, Boulevard Beaumarchais, 98.”</p>

<p>“That is quite a long distance.”</p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle; you know, if you don’t leave the
boulevard, you are soon there.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know all about that, and if there is no great
hurry&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can you carry it within an hour?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go within an hour.”</p>

<p>“By the way, madame wants also to order a smaller
one for to-morrow, to take to a wedding or a ball; madame
will explain to you about it. So she can rely upon
the bouquet, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, monsieur, as I have received the money.
You say Madame de Belleval, Boulevard Beaumarchais,
98?”</p>

<p>“That’s it; good-morning.”</p>

<p>The servant disappeared, and Violette began to select
her finest flowers, saying to herself:<a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a></p>

<p>“It seems that this is likely to be a good customer!
I can make as much as I choose! To think that Georget,
when he was without money the other day and his mother
was sick, didn’t apply to me! And he says that he loves
me! Perhaps I spoke too harshly to him; and he thinks
that I have an unfeeling heart; I don’t want him to think
that!”</p>

<p>When the girl had finished the bouquet, with which
she took the greatest care, she asked a neighbor to look
after her booth and started for Boulevard Beaumarchais;
she arrived at the number given her; she entered an
attractive, newly-built house and asked the concierge:</p>

<p>“Madame de Belleval?”</p>

<p>The concierge assumed the expression of a person
who does not know what one means; then suddenly he
remembered and slapped his leg, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Ah! what a stupid fool I am! I forgot all about it.&mdash;Go
up to the fifth floor, the door at the right, for Madame
de Belleval.”</p>

<p>“The fifth floor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the door at the right.”</p>

<p>Violette went upstairs, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“That concierge acted very strangely when he answered
me; perhaps he always has that manner. It’s
surprising that a lady who buys such handsome bouquets
should live so high; but lodgings are very dear now;
and after all, it’s none of my business.”</p>

<p>And without the slightest suspicion, the girl quickly
climbed the five flights and rang at the door on the right<a name="page_194" id="page_194"></a>
hand. It was opened immediately, and a woman who
had the appearance of a box-opener out of a job said to
Violette:</p>

<p>“Ah! mamzelle has brought the bouquet; that’s good!
Come in, mamzelle, come in.”</p>

<p>“But I only have to deliver the bouquet,&mdash;it is paid
for.”</p>

<p>“No matter; come in, mamzelle, she wants to speak
to you; wait a minute.”</p>

<p>And the girl was almost pushed into a small salon the
door of which was at once closed upon her.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” thought Violette, “that servant told
me that his mistress wanted to order a bouquet for a
ball to-morrow. I will wait. It isn’t very fine here; it’s
pretty enough, but it’s funny that there’s no coquetry, no
taste in the arrangement; I should think that I was in
a gentleman’s room rather than a lady’s. And that
woman who let me in&mdash;she’s neither a lady’s maid nor
a cook. I believe that I am rather frightened here; I
am inclined to go away.”</p>

<p>And Violette had already taken several steps toward
the door of the salon, when it opened and Jéricourt appeared
before her, in dressing-gown and slippers, like a
person in his own home.</p>

<p>The flower girl uttered a cry; she realized that she
had fallen into a trap; but in an instant she recovered
her courage, and Violette had an ample store of it; in
her case, fright was but temporary. She raised her head
therefore and gazed steadfastly at the man before her.<a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a></p>

<p>Jéricourt assumed one of his most winning smiles and
stepped toward the girl.</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect to see me, did you, bewitching
damsel?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, I am waiting for a lady, Madame de
Belleval; am I in her apartment?”</p>

<p>“Madame de Belleval is&mdash;is my aunt, dear child, and
I live with her.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you live here? Well, why doesn’t your aunt
come, monsieur? I have no business with you, and if
this aunt doesn’t mean to come then I will go about my
business.”</p>

<p>And Violette took several steps toward the door; but
Jéricourt barred her passage and led her back into the
salon, saying:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! how quick you are! Are you in such
a great hurry, pray? Take a seat&mdash;she is coming.”</p>

<p>As she did not choose to disclose her apprehensions,
Violette decided to sit down for a moment. Whereupon
the young man also took a chair and placed it beside her
and very near.</p>

<p>“Do you know, charming girl, that I am overjoyed
to have a chat with you at last? I have wanted it a
long while, and it is so hard to obtain the slightest favor
from you!”</p>

<p>“Are you going to repeat the same song as on the
boulevard, monsieur? I know it already; I have no
wish to learn it by heart, for, as I have told you, I don’t
like the tune.<a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>”</p>

<p>“How unkind you are! But this little outburst of
anger makes you prettier than ever! Women who surrender
at once cease to have any value; whereas your
conquest would be a genuine triumph.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt doesn’t come, monsieur, so I will go.”</p>

<p>“My aunt! Ha! ha! ha! that’s a good one! do you
still believe in that, little one?”</p>

<p>“What, monsieur, is it a lie? And this Madame de
Belleval, who sent to me for this bouquet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never existed except in my imagination. I wanted to
decoy you to my rooms, for you refused to come willingly;
so I resorted to stratagem. That’s often done&mdash;it’s
fair fighting.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but it’s an outrage!&mdash;So the concierge whom I
asked for that lady&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I had warned him that someone would ask for a
person of that name, and I ordered him to send her up
to me; it’s as simple as good-day.”</p>

<p>“And that woman who opened the door and told me
that Madame de Belleval would come in a minute&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is an obliging neighbor; I paid her for that little
service with a ticket to the theatre.”</p>

<p>“Why, this is frightful! And there are people who
lend a hand to such outrages!”</p>

<p>“My dear child, you make a great fuss over a very
small matter! To try to obtain a tête-à-tête with a pretty
flower girl is no great crime; I might have kept up the
deception much longer, but I am very honest, you see;
I play with my cards on the table.&mdash;Come, don’t be<a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>
angry; you will have to end by calming down, anyway.
Let’s make peace at once, and seal the treaty with a kiss.”</p>

<p>Before Jéricourt could put his lips to Violette’s face,
she rose and ran toward the door; but the young man
ran after her and detained her by putting his arm about
her waist.</p>

<p>“Oh! you shan’t escape me so, my dear; you are in
my room and we are alone.&mdash;Come, don’t be so cruel;
but let me kiss you.”</p>

<p>“Take care, monsieur; you think that you have a
weak girl to deal with, but I am not afraid of you; you
won’t get anything from me, I give you fair warning;
and if you try to use force, look out! I won’t spare your
face, that you’re so proud of.&mdash;Let me alone, monsieur,
I don’t propose that you shall kiss me.”</p>

<p>Jéricourt paid no heed to the girl’s entreaties; he attempted
to pursue his enterprise, but he met with a
resistance which he was far from expecting; Violette’s
hands were active and strong; she put one of them to
her persecutor’s face and dug her nails in so far that
the blood flowed freely, and the pain forced the young
man to relax his hold. He went to the mirror to look at
himself, and exclaimed angrily:</p>

<p>“That’s an abominable thing for you to do, mademoiselle&mdash;to
scratch my face and mutilate me! only
tigresses do that; it’s only among the <i>canaille</i> that such
things are indulged in.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, monsieur! So I am of the <i>canaille</i> because
I defend myself, because I don’t allow monsieur to take<a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>
liberties with me. Why do you pay any attention to me
then? why do you degrade yourself with a dealer in
flowers?”</p>

<p>“As if I could suspect anything of the kind! To attack
a man’s face&mdash;that’s the worst possible form!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got no more than you deserve, monsieur; I
gave you fair warning; and if you should try again to
keep me, I promise you that you wouldn’t get off so
cheap.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I won’t keep you any longer, mademoiselle, I
have had enough. You are free, but I have some
scratches on my face that I shall not forget! You will
be sorry that you treated me so!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am not afraid of you, monsieur, and I have
proved it. When a man acts as you have done, he
shouldn’t threaten other people&mdash;he should try to be
more decent in order to obtain forgiveness for what he
has done.&mdash;Adieu, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Violette opened the door of the salon, passed through
another small room, and opened another door; but in
her haste she made a mistake; it was not the door leading
to the landing, but she had almost entered the bedroom.
Discovering her error, she retraced her steps, and
at last found the outer door.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jéricourt had followed and overtaken her,
and he tried again to detain her by seizing her dress;
but she roughly shook him off, and with a glance that
banished any desire to stop her again, she rushed out on
the landing and down the stairs, without turning her<a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>
head; nor did she see a young man who was then standing
at his open door, directly opposite Jéricourt’s.</p>

<p>This young man, who was no other than little Astianax,
uttered a cry of surprise on recognizing the girl, who
passed very near him. Having followed her with his
eyes as she descended the stairs, he turned toward Jéricourt,
who was standing in his doorway, and said:</p>

<p>“It is surely she; it’s the pretty flower girl of the
Château d’Eau!&mdash;I say, neighbor, she came out of your
room&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure; you must have seen her come out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I saw her.&mdash;Aha! so the little flower girl
comes to see you! The deuce! you’re a lucky man!”</p>

<p>“It is true, I am generally lucky with women.”</p>

<p>“Is your face inflamed, neighbor, that you are holding
your handkerchief over your cheek?”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a slight toothache.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I confess that I can’t get over it; Mademoiselle
Violette coming out of your room! She was
very red, and decidedly rumpled too!”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;that was the result of our interview.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I understand. Gad! you are favored by
Venus! The pretty flower girl, who made such a parade
of her pride and virtue, and sent me about my business
when I made impassioned speeches to her, and snubbed me
when I proposed to take her to Saint-Germain by train!”</p>

<p>“Let this be a lesson to you, young man; it will teach
you that you mustn’t trust the airs these young women
assume.&mdash;Au revoir, Astianax.<a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>”</p>

<p>“Au revoir, Joconde! Don Juan! Richelieu!”</p>

<p>Jéricourt returned to his room, saying to himself:</p>

<p>“Now I am sure of my revenge! Mademoiselle Violette
will pay dear for the scratches she gave me!”</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br /><br />
<small>A DOWNFALL</small></h2>

<p>Madame de Grangeville, whose place of abode Chicotin
had not been able to ascertain, lived on Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges,
in a small apartment on the fourth floor
of a recently-constructed house.</p>

<p>In houses which have just been finished, and of which
the walls have not had time to dry and the paint to lose
its odor, apartments are very commonly let to persons
who offer to break them in, so to speak. Why are these
persons very often lorettes or ballet-dancers out of employment?
Probably because those ladies know that
very little pains will be taken to seek information about
them, and that they will be accepted as tenants with such
effects as they choose to bring. Landlords are never exacting
with those tenants who are willing to “dry the
walls.”</p>

<p>The Baronne de Grangeville, however, did not belong
to either of the various classes of women who are in the
habit of hiring apartments without asking the price, and<a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>
who reply to those persons who remark that their rent is
high: “What difference does that make to me? I never
pay!”</p>

<p>However, from her position, her tastes and her habits,
it was impossible to mistake her position in life; it was
easy to see that that lady had fallen from opulence.</p>

<p>Her furniture still retained some traces of her former
opulence: it included a dressing-table and a couch of extreme
daintiness, and side by side with them, easy-chairs
and common chairs that were out of style, spotted and in
wretched condition. There were ample curtains, large
and small, in her bedroom; there were only very small
ones in her salon. The dining-room was almost bare and
there was very little furniture in the kitchen, but the
baroness never, or very rarely, had cooking done in her
apartment; she sent out to a restaurant for her meals;
that way of living is more expensive, but Madame de
Grangeville had never chosen to take the trouble to calculate,
or to pay any heed to her expenses; so long as
she had had a regular income, she had thought of nothing
but satisfying her fancies, her most trifling desires,
without stopping to think whether her means were sufficient
for her innumerable whims; people who have no
idea of order when they are young, rarely change when
they are older; with them things go as best they can;
they never think of the morrow. Such people are very
agreeable in society and are generally considered very
generous; they have nothing of their own and everyone
exclaims:<a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a></p>

<p>“Ah! what an excellent heart!”</p>

<p>I consider that only those persons have a good heart
who give what they themselves possess, and who, before
everything, pay their creditors and do not run into debt.
If you make a present to a friend, if you open your purse
to obsequious flatterers who surround you, you inflict a
real injury on your tailor whom you do not pay, on the
restaurant keeper whom you put off from day to day by
giving him small sums on account; it is not with your
money that you are generous, but with that of your
creditors. There are people who distribute alms after becoming
bankrupt, and who pose as benefactors of mankind.
There are such people who have great reputations
for kindness of heart, for whom I have very little esteem!
If you scratch the surface, you soon come to the rock.</p>

<p>As Madame de Grangeville could not afford to keep
both a lady’s maid and a cook, she had dismissed the
latter, whom it would have been more sensible to keep;
unfortunately, she could not do without a lady’s maid;
she would gladly have kept her cook as well, but the latter
had become tired of buying food on credit at the dealers’,
who also were tired of supplying goods without being
paid.</p>

<p>When Madame Roc, that was the cook’s name, went to
her mistress to ask for money, she would throw herself
back on her couch and hold a phial of smelling salts to
her nose, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh! Madame Roc, have you come to talk about
money again? Leave me in peace, I beg you. I have an<a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>
attack of vapors already, and you will give me an attack
of hysteria.”</p>

<p>“But, madame, for dinner&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother me about dinner; do what you choose;
I give you <i>carte blanche</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i>Carte blanche</i> isn’t money, and they all want money;
I can’t say to the butcher: ‘I have <i>carte blanche</i> to pay
for your fillet.’”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! how you tire me! how you make my
head ache!”</p>

<p>“But, madame, if I shouldn’t get any dinner for you,
would you like that?”</p>

<p>“Heavens! how you annoy me, how intolerable you
are! Go away, I tell you again, and leave me!”</p>

<p>This little scene, which is of frequent occurrence in
Paris, will give an idea of the sort of person that the
Baronne de Grangeville was. When the cook had been
dismissed, matters arranged themselves better with the
lady’s maid; she, being accustomed to flatter her mistresses
in order to obtain a dress or a scarf, knew a thousand
tricks to deceive creditors, to put them off the scent
and send them away; and that was just the sort of lady’s
maid that Madame de Grangeville needed.</p>

<p>However, everything has an end, the patience of creditors
no less than the confidence of dealers. Discovering
a little late that she was likely to find herself in a very
critical situation, after squandering a part of her principal,
she sold what little she had left, and with the proceeds
took it into her head to gamble on the Bourse.<a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>
That was as good a way as another; it was a matter of
luck, and she could still dream of wealth; for people who
are devoid of order, it is a masterstroke to be able to rely
on chance.</p>

<p>One morning, Madame de Grangeville, who had just
risen and taken her chocolate <i>à la vanille</i>, told Lizida, her
maid, to go out and buy a newspaper which had the quotations
of railroad and manufacturing stocks.</p>

<p>The maid hastened to obey her mistress; the latter
looked at herself in a mirror, as she tried on a very fashionable
cap which she had worn only three times, but
which did not rejuvenate her as much as she wished.</p>

<p>“Here is the paper, madame,” said Lizida, eyeing her
mistress’s cap, which she coveted; “I inquired about the
Mouzaias; hasn’t madame some Mouzaia stocks?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have twenty shares; my last hope is in that.”</p>

<p>“What are the Mouzaias, madame? a sugar factory?”</p>

<p>“Alas! no, it isn’t sugar. I believe it’s a copper mine
in Algeria; I don’t know exactly, but it doesn’t make any
difference; a friend of mine doubled her money six
months ago by buying shares in it; and I hope to double
mine; but thus far I haven’t had any luck.&mdash;Do you
think my cap is becoming, Lizida?”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu, madame, it’s strange&mdash;but if you want
my opinion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To be sure, when I ask for it.”</p>

<p>“Well! madame, who is always so pretty&mdash;I don’t
know how it is, but with that cap madame has a stern,
serious look.<a name="page_205" id="page_205"></a>”</p>

<p>“Say at once that it makes me older, for that is what
you don’t dare to say.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it isn’t that; madame can’t look old; that is
impossible; but madame has a less animated, less coquettish
air&mdash;that’s it, less coquettish.”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville snatched off her cap and threw
it on a chair, crying:</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Lizida; this cap certainly does
make me a frightful object.”</p>

<p>“Oh! frightful! As if madame could be frightful
when&mdash;when she is so pretty!”</p>

<p>“Hush, child; take the cap; I give it to you, it’s yours,
do what you choose with it.”</p>

<p>“Madame is too good; but I wouldn’t want madame to
think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I tell you to take that cap, I never want to hear of it
again. Go and get me the little blue one that I wore
before I bought that one.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Lizida ran from the room to fetch the
cap which her mistress asked for, and handed it to her;
then she made haste to take to her own room the cap
for which the baroness had paid thirty-five francs and
which she had worn but three times, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“I knew very well that I should get it! Oh! it is a
perfect beauty! It makes me look like an angel, and I
will wear it on Sunday to go to the Château des Fleurs to
dance.&mdash;How lovely it is!”</p>

<p>Then she returned to her mistress, who had put on the
blue cap, and cried:<a name="page_206" id="page_206"></a></p>

<p>“Oh! how lovely madame is in that! madame is only
twenty-five years old,&mdash;not a day more. Ah! if I was a
man, how madly in love I should be with madame!”</p>

<p>“Hush, you mad girl! It’s a fact that this cap is very
becoming to me.”</p>

<p>“Madame, you must have another one just like it made
at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what I intend to do, when I am in funds.&mdash;Let
me look at the newspaper, the quotations; I don’t
understand them very well.”</p>

<p>“Madame, I was told that the Mouzaias had gone up.”</p>

<p>“Really? Oh! if only that were true! for I bought
twenty shares at par, and they have fallen to forty-eight
francs. Let me see,&mdash;a rise of fifty centimes! That is
magnificent!”</p>

<p>“Then madame has not made anything?”</p>

<p>“If I should sell now, I shouldn’t get back a thousand
francs of the two thousand that I invested; I should lose
more than half!”</p>

<p>“Then you mustn’t sell, madame!”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t sell, but I must have money. I have promised
to go to Nogent, to visit those Glumeaus, who are
to have a family party, with theatricals.”</p>

<p>“The Glumeaus! Who on earth are they? Retired
grocers?”</p>

<p>“No, they are&mdash;Faith, I don’t know what they used
to do, nor do I care. If I had to inquire about such
things as that, should I ever go into society? But they
are excellent people; one enjoys oneself at their house;<a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a>
it is just like being at home. The company is a little
mixed there perhaps, but isn’t it so everywhere? I met
at Monsieur Glumeau’s a person whom I used to know,
before I was married.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it must have been a long while ago then!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Lizida had no sooner made this remark
than she saw that she had put her foot in it; she made
haste to add:</p>

<p>“When I said a long time, I said something very foolish;
I spoke without thinking, for after all, I have no
idea whether madame was married long ago, any more
than I know how long madame has been a widow. Sometimes
one is widowed right away. A husband doesn’t
always last a year.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my poor Lizida, there are many other things
that you don’t know, and that would surprise you greatly
if I should tell you them!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Lizida, who was inquisitive like all lady’s
maids, seeing that her mistress was in one of those moods
when one longs to disclose one’s secrets, to confide the
most private mysteries which a woman always tires of
keeping to herself, employed at first her usual tactics to
make herself agreeable to her mistress.</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! how very becoming that little blue cap is
to madame! It gives her such a charming air! But then,
madame always has that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there are days when one looks better than
on others; everybody is like that; to-day certainly seems
to be one of my good days.<a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>”</p>

<p>“It would seem then that madame was married very
young?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very young; I was seventeen years old, not
more.”</p>

<p>“What a sweet little bride madame must have been!”</p>

<p>“Yes, everybody admired me!”</p>

<p>“And madame’s husband, the Baron de Grangeville,
was he young? Was he a fine-looking man?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, my husband was a fine man, very good-looking,
with a somewhat serious expression.&mdash;Would
you believe, my dear child, that I was mad over that
man?”</p>

<p>“Pray, madame, why not? There are wives who adore
their husbands; it isn’t very common, but such things are
seen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I adored him&mdash;the first year after our marriage.”</p>

<p>“Ah! only the first year?”</p>

<p>“Men are agreeable for such a short time!”</p>

<p>“Oh! how true that is!&mdash;And madame’s husband became
like the others, no doubt, surly, moody, fault-finding.
There are some men who refuse their wives everything,
even a cashmere shawl; and everybody knows that
a woman who goes into good society cannot do without a
cashmere shawl! The idea of such a thing! what would
she look like?”</p>

<p>“My husband found no fault with my taste for dress;
besides, I had my own money; I brought him twelve
thousand francs a year when I married him.<a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a>”</p>

<p>“Well! if with that amount the wife was not the mistress,
it would be funny!”</p>

<p>“But he had nearly twenty thousand francs a year.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have lived very handsomely! Ah!
your maid must have been very lucky! madame is so
noble, so generous! madame was born to be waited upon;
anyone can see that at once.”</p>

<p>“But my husband became jealous, so jealous that he
made himself ridiculous!”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is another fault of these men! to be jealous!
and what good does it do them, I ask you? None at all,
except to bore their wives! and when a woman is bored,
why, bless my soul, she seeks some sort of distraction!
I say, madame, as monsieur le baron had become so jealous,
it seems to me that you should not have been very
sorry to be left a widow.&mdash;Dear me! what lovely pink
cheeks madame has to-day!”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville smiled at herself in the mirror
which stood before her; then, throwing herself back
in an armchair, she said with a little sigh:</p>

<p>“Ah! you don’t know all, Lizida. What I am going to
tell you will surprise you tremendously! but you must be
very discreet, and never mention it to anyone!”</p>

<p>“Madame must know me, she knows that I am not a
chatterbox; I would rather be chopped in pieces than betray
a secret.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I am not a widow.”</p>

<p>“Oho! is it possible? Madame’s husband is still
alive?<a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what is more, I know from someone who
has met him lately that he is living in Paris at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is news indeed; the Baron de Grangeville
is alive!”</p>

<p>“Not the Baron de Grangeville, for that isn’t his
name; I did not choose to bear his name any longer.”</p>

<p>“I understand; so madame is not really a baroness
then?”</p>

<p>“I was a countess, Lizida, which is much better; for
my husband is a count!”</p>

<p>“Oh! excuse me, madame, excuse me! madame la
comtesse! Ah! ‘madame la comtesse’! how lovely it is
to say that! will you allow me to call you that, madame?”</p>

<p>“No, you would become accustomed to it; besides,
I don’t want that title any more, it would remind me of a
time that I wish to forget.”</p>

<p>“Oh! of course, since madame was so unhappy with
her husband, that she was obliged to leave him&mdash;after
many years, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Why, no; we had been married hardly three years
when we separated.”</p>

<p>“Only three years! That isn’t very long! Was he
very unkind from the beginning, that husband of yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he began to be very&mdash;very ridiculous at once!”</p>

<p>“Madame had no children?”</p>

<p>“No, I had none.”</p>

<p>“That is very lucky, for sometimes there is a dispute
as to who shall have the children, or who shall not have<a name="page_211" id="page_211"></a>
them; whereas, when there are none, it’s: ‘Adieu, bonsoir;
we can’t live together any longer, let us part!’&mdash;Isn’t
that the way it’s done, madame?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so easy as that when you wish to separate
according to law, and that is what we did, Monsieur de&mdash;my
husband having his separate property and I mine,
we both took our own.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but if your husband should die, madame, would
you inherit from him?”</p>

<p>“No indeed, I should not get a sou.”</p>

<p>“How unjust that is! Just think of that! A poor
little woman gives herself to a man who makes her unhappy,
and if he dies, she doesn’t inherit! And monsieur
le comte, your husband, has at least twenty thousand
francs a year, you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh! in more than nineteen years that have passed,
it seems that he has doubled his fortune at least, in undertakings,
speculations.”</p>

<p>“What! nineteen years madame has left her husband?”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville made a gesture of irritation,
and the maid made haste to add:</p>

<p>“No, no, that is not possible; madame made a mistake;
doubtless madame meant to say nine years.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right, I did make a mistake; it is much
less. However, what does it matter? It is of no use
to think about that any more.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, madame,&mdash;don’t be offended at what I
am going to say; it is an idea that came into my head,
and I submit it to you.<a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a>”</p>

<p>“Go on; you know very well that I never am angry.”</p>

<p>“Well, since madame’s former husband is so rich, and
madame finds herself annoyed, besieged by those demons
of creditors, as we have been for some time&mdash;suppose
madame should send to monsieur le comte and ask him
to let her have a few thousand-franc notes&mdash;would he
refuse them?”</p>

<p>“O Lizida! that is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Why so? Just let madame tell me her husband’s
name and address, and I will willingly undertake the
errand.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible, Lizida, because I don’t choose to do
it, because I shall never apply to the count. No, I would
prefer to be deprived of everything, rather than let him
know my position. Besides, he would reply: ‘You
had your property, madame. You should have kept
it.’”</p>

<p>“Kept it! kept it! That is very easy to say; but madame
has such a kind heart, she is so noble, so generous&mdash;madame
has too noble a mind to know how to calculate.
Pshaw! it is only the petty bourgeois who do that!”</p>

<p>“But they are wise, perhaps!”</p>

<p>“To think that madame is not a widow! I cannot
get over it. So that is the reason that madame does not
marry. See how wicked it is to forbid divorce!”</p>

<p>“If only those infernal Mouzaias would go back to the
price I paid for them! I absolutely must have some
money; I am going to Nogent in four days; they are
going to have theatricals, there’ll be a great many people<a name="page_213" id="page_213"></a>
there, and I must have another bonnet; mine is no longer
fresh enough.”</p>

<p>“It is true that it is beginning to be unworthy of madame;
and madame is always so well dressed that everybody
always admires her costume!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I used to be one of the women who were famous
for their taste in dress; I set the fashion.”</p>

<p>“Madame might set the fashion again if she would.”</p>

<p>“Say rather if I could, my dear Lizida! But listen&mdash;someone
rang; if it is Monsieur de Merval, you will let
him come in; he is the person whom I met at the Glumeaus’.”</p>

<p>“But if it’s an <i>Englishman</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A creditor! Mon Dieu! you know well enough what
you must say to them, for you are used to receiving those
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, madame, I will get around him.”</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<br /><br />
<small>AN OLD FRIEND</small></h2>

<p>The lady’s maid went to the door. Madame de Grangeville
took her place anew before her dressing-table, and
arranged her cap and her hair. To try to attract, to appear
young, was in her a desire so identified with her
nature, that she would go to look at herself in her mirror
before allowing a chimney sweep to enter her room.<a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a></p>

<p>But no one appeared; she heard only the sound of
voices in the reception room. It lasted some time, and
Madame de Grangeville, who divined what was happening,
threw herself back in her chair and began to look
over the newspaper as if what were going on in her
reception room did not concern her.</p>

<p>After some little time the outer door closed and Mademoiselle
Lizida reappeared, crying:</p>

<p>“Heavens! how unendurable those people are getting
to be! They have no manners at all; I thought that it
would never end.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! it was that idiot of a grocer opposite,
who has taken it into his head to come himself now.”</p>

<p>“The grocer! what on earth can I owe to a grocer? I
don’t eat here, that is to say, I send out for everything.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, no cooking is done in madame’s apartment,
but I make her chocolate; and then candles,&mdash;madame
uses a great many of them; and I have to have
oil for the lamps, and then sugar&mdash;we can’t get along
without sugar&mdash;and tea, and coffee&mdash;I take coffee in the
morning. And then soap, and matches, and I don’t know
what; there’s no end to the things, although we seem
not to need anything.&mdash;In fact, he demands a total of
ninety-six francs!”</p>

<p>“As much as that for trifles?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame. I tell you the sugar goes fast, when
one drinks tea!”</p>

<p>“Well, I will pay him when I have money.<a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>”</p>

<p>“That’s what I told him; but would you believe,
madame, that he had the face to reply: ‘Your mistress
has money enough to hire cabs, for she goes out in them
often enough; she ought to have some to pay her
grocer!’”</p>

<p>“What a shocking thing! Why, it is disgusting!
The idea! I must stop to think before taking a cab, because
of a miserable creditor!”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame, things have got to that point. That is
the result of our revolutions.”</p>

<p>“Lizida, you will get nothing more at that man’s shop,
I forbid you!”</p>

<p>“Oh! madame has no need to forbid me, there’s no
danger of my going there again; besides, he wouldn’t
let me have anything more on credit! He says that if he
doesn’t get his money in two days he’ll go before the
justice of the peace.”</p>

<p>“All right! let him go before his justice of the peace!
I won’t go myself, that’s all.&mdash;How unfortunate it is to
have to do with such people!&mdash;Heavens!&mdash;someone else
is ringing; can it be that that clown has come back?”</p>

<p>“This time I will take my broom, and if it’s the grocer
again, I will sweep his legs out from under him!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Lizida went out in a rage. Madame de
Grangeville listened, this time with some little emotion;
but she heard no voices, it was evidently not a creditor.
The maid reappeared with a very different expression.</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Merval asks if he may present his respects
to madame la baronne?<a name="page_216" id="page_216"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure; show him in.”</p>

<p>And the baroness made haste to cast another glance at
the mirror, to arrange her hair and to assume a gracious
attitude in her easy-chair.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval was ushered into the room; he
entered with the exquisite courtesy which distinguished
him, and took a chair near Madame de Grangeville, who
said to him with her most engaging smile:</p>

<p>“I am very glad that you remembered the promise that
you gave me at Monsieur Glumeau’s. I did not rely very
much upon it.”</p>

<p>“Why so, madame? Do you think that I also was not
delighted to meet again, to see once more, a person who
carried me back to the pleasant days of my youth&mdash;in
memory, to be sure; but those memories are too agreeable
ever to be effaced entirely.”</p>

<p>“Dear Armand!&mdash;I beg pardon, will you permit me
still to call you so?”</p>

<p>“It is a token of friendship for which I thank you.”</p>

<p>“I was unmarried when I knew you; we used to meet
often at parties; then you came to my uncle’s house.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame, yes, the evenings at your uncle’s were
delightful; you did the honors with such grace; so
that we rated ourselves as very fortunate when we were
on the list of your guests.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we used to have music and singing. Do you remember
little Dumesnil, how false she sang?”</p>

<p>“I remember especially that you sang like an angel.
We used to dance, too, quite often.<a name="page_217" id="page_217"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, while the sober people played whist or bouillotte.
You waltzed divinely, Armand; you were our best
waltzer.”</p>

<p>“True, the waltz was my specialty.”</p>

<p>“And you never were able to make tall Adèle Brillange
dance in time; do you remember her&mdash;rather a pretty
blonde?”</p>

<p>“Really, I hardly remember her. Just remember that
that was fully twenty-three or twenty-four years ago!”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville bit her lips, not at all pleased
to find that her old acquaintance remembered dates so
well.</p>

<p>“Do you still waltz, Monsieur de Merval?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is all over, madame; I have had my day.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! to hear you, one would think that
we belonged to the age of Louis XV!”</p>

<p>“No one would think so to look at you, madame; time
has stood still for you.”</p>

<p>This compliment restored the serenity of Madame de
Grangeville’s expression, and she replied, simpering a
little:</p>

<p>“Ah! you are always agreeable; would that I were
back in those happy days! Tell me, Armand, if I remember
aright, you used to pay court to me then,&mdash;yes, you
were very attentive to me.”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval seemed decidedly embarrassed; he
glanced about the salon and replied at last:</p>

<p>“I don’t deny it, madame, but I remember also that as
soon as the Comte de Brévanne was introduced to you,<a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a>
discovering that his love was welcomed with enthusiasm,
I thought only of making an honorable retreat; and I
was wise, as the count became your husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he became my husband.”</p>

<p>“It was a love match, was it not, madame?”</p>

<p>“Oh! mon Dieu! is it possible to say, when one is so
young? One always imagines that one is in love, but one
does not even know what love is. You must have been
very much surprised to learn that I was no longer living
with Monsieur de Brévanne?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame; and yet such things happen rather
often.”</p>

<p>“Look you, Armand, I am sorry that I didn’t marry
you; we should never have parted.”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval shook his head slightly and answered
with a smile:</p>

<p>“No one knows, no one knows!”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville blushed, then assumed a serious
air.</p>

<p>“You may perhaps believe all the slanders that Monsieur
de Brévanne no doubt spread about me?”</p>

<p>“I knew nothing, heard nothing, madame. Monsieur
de Brévanne is too well-bred a man to say anything
which could possibly injure your reputation.”</p>

<p>“Oh! when a man is jealous, monsieur, when he fancies
himself betrayed, he is sometimes so absurd!”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval made no reply, but continued to
look about the salon, and seemed painfully affected by
the lack of harmony in the furniture.<a name="page_219" id="page_219"></a></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Madame de Grangeville after a long pause,
“women are always the victims; that is their fate; the
men make the laws for us, and we are the weaker
party in every respect; we must needs endure the harsh
treatment, the violent scenes, the sarcasms of those gentlemen.
I tell you, Armand, that all the fault is on the men’s
part; I know it, poor abandoned wife that I am!”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval, who seemed far from convinced
by the lamentations of his old acquaintance, rejoined:</p>

<p>“And Monsieur de Roncherolle, what have you done
with him, madame? He was a very amiable, very gallant
gentleman, who had great success with the ladies. A
good-looking fellow, a hard drinker, and of a courage
proof against any test; he had everything that a man
needs to succeed.”</p>

<p>The face of the abandoned wife had undergone a complete
transformation; her lips were compressed, her
brow was wrinkled, her eyes assumed a vague expression,
and she retorted in a decidedly curt tone:</p>

<p>“Why do you apply to me for news of Monsieur de
Roncherolle? What reason have you to think that I can
tell you anything about him?”</p>

<p>“Really, madame, I had no idea of offending you by
asking you that question; but a good friend of mine
who met you thirteen or fourteen years ago in the Pyrenees,
at the Baths of Bagnères, I believe, told me then
that you were travelling with Roncherolle; that was
what made me think that perhaps you still kept up some
relations with him.<a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a>”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville was disconcerted.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” she stammered, “that is true; I did meet
Monsieur de Roncherolle when I was travelling in the
Pyrenees, and we travelled together for some little time.
Well, Monsieur de Merval, do you see any harm in that?
After all, wasn’t I at liberty to travel with whomever I
pleased, since I had already been separated from my
husband for several years?”</p>

<p>“I have already had the honor to tell you, madame,
that I see no harm anywhere; I simply repeated what
I have heard, as we were talking of our old acquaintances,
that is all.&mdash;And in your financial affairs, I most sincerely
hope that you have not suffered, madame? You
had an independent fortune, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true, I had a fortune&mdash;I had one.”</p>

<p>“What! have you had the misfortune to suffer from
somebody’s bankruptcy?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think so; and then, you know, women
are so stupid about managing their property.”</p>

<p>“But when it is simply a matter of receiving income,
one does not need a business agent for that.”</p>

<p>The bell rang again. The baroness started, and Monsieur
de Merval took his hat, saying:</p>

<p>“Somebody has come to visit you, madame, and I
will take my leave.”</p>

<p>“Why no, don’t go yet, I beg you; it is no visitor, I
expect no one; no one ever comes to see me now!”</p>

<p>The poor woman said this in such a melancholy tone
that Monsieur de Merval was touched; he replaced his<a name="page_221" id="page_221"></a>
hat on the chair, and his eyes rested again on various
parts of the furniture, which clearly betrayed the lamentable
plight of their owner. As he passed these objects in
review, in order to conceal what was in his mind, he
began to talk about the Glumeau family; but soon a
hoarse voice arose in the reception room and dominated
Lizida’s, although she did her utmost to drown it.</p>

<p>Thereupon Madame de Grangeville also tried to talk
very loud, so that her visitor should not hear the altercation
which was taking place in her reception room. She
even tried to laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! ha! ha! ha! that party that those good
people gave was very comical; there were such amusing
faces there! They put me at the table beside an old
gentleman who looked like an owl. Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>But the noise in the reception room did not cease, and
Madame de Grangeville laughed on the wrong side of her
mouth. Monsieur de Merval, while doing his best not
to listen, could not, unless he had stuffed his ears, help
hearing a stentorian voice shout:</p>

<p>“I won’t go away! I want my money! I said to my
wife: ‘They’ll send you to the devil with your bill; I’m
going myself!&mdash;<i>Fichtre!</i> I won’t go away without the
money!”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval, who had been pensive and preoccupied
for several minutes, suddenly said to his old
friend:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! how thoughtless I am, madame! I knew
that I had something else to say to you, but while we<a name="page_222" id="page_222"></a>
were talking I forgot it; it is a mere trifle, an old debt
that I desire to pay, if you will allow me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“This is how it is: the last time that I was with Monsieur
de Brévanne, a very long time ago, we played cards,
and I lost five hundred francs to him on credit, for I
had no money with me. After that, I tried in vain to
find the count; he had left Paris suddenly. Now, as I
have found his wife to-day, I ask permission to cancel a
debt which troubles me. If you will allow me to hand
you that amount, you will do me a favor.”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville blushed slightly as she replied:</p>

<p>“But I don’t know whether I ought to accept; Monsieur
de Brévanne and I no longer have any property in
common.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t go into all those details,” replied Monsieur
de Merval, as he took from his wallet a five-hundred-franc
note and laid it on the table. “I am only paying
an old debt which I had on my conscience, and surely an
old friend like you would not prevent me from accomplishing
that duty.&mdash;Adieu, madame, I am obliged to
leave you; pray receive the homage of my respect.”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval kissed the baroness’s hand and
hurried out of the room; as he passed through the reception
room, he saw a man pacing the floor with his hat
on his head, paying no heed to Mademoiselle Lizida’s
entreaties.</p>

<p>This personage stared in an impertinent fashion at
the gentleman going out; but Monsieur de Merval paid<a name="page_223" id="page_223"></a>
little heed to him; he was pleased to have put his old
friend in a position to get rid of her visitor.</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville had not been deceived by the
little fable invented by Monsieur de Merval in order to
oblige her; she had said to herself:</p>

<p>“That was very nice on his part; it was a very
delicate proceeding; but after all, he is rich; he guessed
that I needed money, and he has lent me some; it’s a
simple matter.&mdash;Lizida! Lizida!”</p>

<p>The lady’s maid hurried into the room, and was stupefied
when her mistress handed her a bank note.</p>

<p>“Here, my dear, go out and change this!”</p>

<p>“O madame! five hundred francs! How lovely!”</p>

<p>“Who is that wretched creature outside?”</p>

<p>“Your dressmaker’s husband; he demands the total
of the bill, one hundred and twenty-three francs!”</p>

<p>“Take him with you, and pay him.”</p>

<p>“The whole amount?”</p>

<p>“There’s no help for it; his wife works beautifully,
and I always need her. Go, and bring back a coupé when
you come; I will go out to buy a hat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.&mdash;By the way, what about the grocer
opposite?”</p>

<p>“What do we owe him?”</p>

<p>“Ninety-six francs.”</p>

<p>“Give him ten francs on account, that is quite enough.<a name="page_224" id="page_224"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br /><br />
<small>THE HOUSE AT NOGENT.&mdash;THE REHEARSAL</small></h2>

<p>Everything was made ready at Monsieur Glumeau’s
country house for the festivities which he had announced
long before to his friends and acquaintances. The day
was fixed, the invitations issued. They had invited four
times as many people as the house could hold; but in
default of the house there was a garden, and over and
above the garden there was a wood of about two acres;
the guests who could not find room in the house had
their choice between the wood and the garden; in the
country there is always some way to arrange matters.</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau’s country house was nevertheless
quite large and very well arranged. The garden was attractive
and well filled with flowers; but the most attractive
part of the whole estate was the little wood.
Unfortunately it did not adjoin the garden; it was separated
from it by a narrow path, not more than ten feet
wide, which was open to the public. But the garden
gate was opposite the gate leading into the wood, and
the path was so quickly crossed that the separation was
hardly noticeable. The one thing that the estate lacked
was water; but pending the time when a river should
appear, Monsieur Glumeau had had made behind his<a name="page_225" id="page_225"></a>
theatre a small basin, of about the capacity of two casks,
in which one might at need have taken a foot bath.</p>

<p>It was in this little wood, enclosed by trellis work,
which was supported by stone posts at intervals, that
Monsieur Glumeau had conceived the idea of building
a small theatre. The stage was supplied with all the
accessories: wings, flies, arches, and drop curtain. But
when the action of the play took place in a forest, instead
of using a rear curtain, they simply used the wings, and
the wood itself formed natural scenery, and afforded a
lovely prospect which it is impossible to have in the city,
even at the grand opera.</p>

<p>The theatre was covered with a board roof, which
sheltered the scenery and the actors from possible storms.
But as there was no auditorium, as the spectators simply
sat or stood under the trees, in front of the drop curtain,
it was most important for them that the weather should
be fine, for rain would very speedily drive the audience
away and leave the auditorium empty.</p>

<p>The friends who had accepted parts in the plays that
were to be given came twice a week to pass the day with
Glumeau, in order to rehearse.</p>

<p>Very often the time passed away and there was no rehearsal;
the men played billiards or bouillotte, the women
went out to ride, with or without donkeys; sometimes
someone sat at the piano and sang. They dined very late
and remained at the table a long while. When they left
it, they had not the slightest desire to study their parts;
but they began to dance a polka or a waltz; thus it<a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a>
was that almost all the rehearsals were held, but they
enjoyed themselves, so that the desired result was attained.</p>

<p>But when they realized that the great day was near
at hand, they began to say to themselves: “We really
must rehearse.”&mdash;Monsieur Glumeau, who had been very
well for some time, was in a charming mood and fluttered
from one to another, looking at his feet; he gave
counsel and advice to everyone, and insisted that they
should introduce spoken pantomime in the plays and
dancing in the pantomime; he transformed everything
into a ballet.</p>

<p>The performance decided upon consisted of <i>Œil et Nez</i>,
a farce in one act, with three characters, to be played by
Madame Dufournelle, young Astianax, and Monsieur
Mangeot.</p>

<p>This piece, being easy to rehearse, and having almost
no mise-en-scène, was almost learned; young Astianax
declared that it would go as if it were on wheels, and
that it was not necessary to give any more thought to it.</p>

<p>The second play was also a farce: <i>Il y a plus d’un Ane
à la Foire.</i>&mdash;In this there were seven characters, four men
and three women; the men’s parts were entrusted to
Messieurs Glumeau, Mangeot, Astianax and Kingerie;
the actresses were Mesdemoiselles Eolinde, Polymnie and
Mangeot.</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau had the most important part, that
of Pincette, created with much success by Serres at the
Folies-Dramatiques. It was very long, and Monsieur<a name="page_227" id="page_227"></a>
Glumeau had decided that it was quite useless to try to
drive it into his head, where he was certain that he could
never succeed in introducing it; but he relied on the
prompter to supplement his memory, and proposed to
replace such parts of the dialogue as he did not know
by pantomime and dancing.</p>

<p>But it was for the third play that they reserved all the
striking effects, all the surprises, all the finest scenery
and most amazing costumes that they had. This play was
<i>Roderic et Cunégonde</i>, or <i>L’Ermite de Montmartre</i>, or
<i>La Forteresse de Moulinos</i>, or <i>Le Revenant de la Galerie
de l’Ouest</i>, an excellent parody of melodramas, in four
tableaux, <i>larded</i>, as the book says, with dancing, fighting,
manœuvring, conflagrations and destruction.</p>

<p>This play, the action of which takes place wherever
you choose, allows the most fanciful costumes to be used.
Wooden swords and daggers had been made, with which
the combats were to be fought. Chambourdin, who was
very intimate with several dramatic artists, had promised
to bring the costumes; the non-speaking parts were to be
represented by the gardener and his family and anyone
else who chose. The élite of the troupe took part in this
play: Mademoiselle Eolinde played Cunégonde, her
brother, Roderic, and Monsieur Glumeau took the part
of the tyrant Sacripandos; the leader of the brigands,
Détroussandos, was entrusted to a young druggist of
most promising talent, named Fourriette, who insisted
upon always rehearsing his fights with the wooden
swords. Monsieur Mangeot represented the hermit; the<a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a>
part of the valet Malinot fell as of right to young Kingerie.
In order to have a second female part, they had
transformed Petit-Colas into Petite-Colette, and Mademoiselle
Polymnie had accepted this bit of a part, because
of the costume. There was also a child’s part. The
son of Pichet the gardener, a little boy of five, who never
blew his nose, but whose parents had promised to do it
for him on that day, was employed to represent the son
of Roderic and Cunégonde. His father the gardener
had undertaken to teach him the few words of which his
part consisted; he beat it into his head with an accompaniment
of kicks, which gave the little fellow small
taste for the theatre. Lastly, the three speaking robbers
in the play were to be acted by Chambourdin and two of
his friends. As each rôle would be but four lines, it was
hoped that those gentlemen would succeed in learning
them.</p>

<p>The great day had arrived; the weather was fine and
promised a magnificent day and evening, which were
quite indispensable for the success of the party. At daybreak
everybody was up at Monsieur Glumeau’s country
house. Buxom Lolotte, although she did not act, was
one of those who had most to do; as mistress of the
house, she must overlook everything, see to it that everything
needed for the play was provided, and attend to
the preparations for the ball which was to follow it, and
for the supper which was to follow the ball. For there
is no such thing as a successful party without a supper;
this principle is so fully admitted that those persons who<a name="page_229" id="page_229"></a>
entertain you without offering you that refection should
be classed among people who do not know how to entertain.</p>

<p>Those who were to take part in the play were to arrive
early, for it was felt that there should be another rehearsal,
because there are innumerable things, innumerable
details of the mise-en-scène, which one does not
notice until the moment of the performance; it is then
a little late to rehearse them, but the zeal of the actors
makes up for the lack of time.</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau had risen as light as a feather, he
was not conscious of the slightest ailment, and he continued
to dance through his rôles; frequently confusing
that of the tyrant Sacripandos with that of Pincette in
the farce. But, after all, it was probable that the audience
would not detect that confusion. As he was hurrying
to the wood, to cast an eye over his stage, he met
his wife, who was returning from a visit to the best
caterer in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear love, we are lucky, we are going to
have splendid weather, weather which seems to have been
made for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank God! it is fine; but I can’t do any more;
I am fagged out already; I doubt if I shall be able to
stand up to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why fatigue yourself so? Haven’t you your maid,
and the gardener and his wife to do whatever you want?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! that would be very nice; things would go
splendidly this evening if I trusted to those people! The<a name="page_230" id="page_230"></a>
gardener’s wife is so stupid, she has already broken three
lamp chimneys and a globe! Her husband is a little
drunk already; if he keeps on he will be in fine condition
to-night!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, I will speak to him. But what have you
left to do? The supper is to consist almost entirely of
cold dishes; you arranged all that in advance, and the
caterer knows what he is to send.”</p>

<p>“And the dinner, monsieur&mdash;isn’t it necessary to think
of that, too?”</p>

<p>“The dinner? Oh! there will only be our intimate
friends, and there is no need of ceremony about that.”</p>

<p>“No ceremony, if you please, but there will be at least
fourteen or fifteen of us, and it seems to me that we need
something for that number!”</p>

<p>“I have difficulty in remembering my song to the tune
of Le Maçon: ‘Je vais la revoir! Ha! ha!’&mdash;Never
mind, I will execute a pirouette.&mdash;I say, Lolotte, I look
pretty well, don’t I? Isn’t my complexion clear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are magnificent.&mdash;By the way, my dear, I
forgot to tell you that I have invited that gentleman who
owns the fine estate on the other side of our woods.”</p>

<p>“Who? Monsieur Malberg? that man who never
speaks to anybody, who never walks where there is likely
to be anybody; in short, who lives in his country house
like a wolf, never seeing any of his neighbors?”</p>

<p>“I know very well that the people about here say all
that; but people are so spiteful, so evil-tongued in these
country places! They make a pumpkin of a walnut.<a name="page_231" id="page_231"></a>
This much is certain, that that gentleman has always been
very courteous to us; he always bows first when we
meet; and he has a very distinguished manner.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Why, his whole air, and his dress; and then he employs
a mulatto, and that is very distinguished!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t cost any more than other servants.&mdash;‘Je
vais la revoir! Ha! ha!’”</p>

<p>“And yesterday, during the day, I happened to meet
him in the narrow path, and as he stood aside very
politely to let me pass, I said to him: ‘Monsieur, we are
to have some theatricals to-morrow in our little theatre
in these woods; if it would give you any pleasure to
come to look on, we should be flattered to have you in our
audience.’&mdash;He bowed and replied: ‘You do me much
honor, madame, and I shall try to take advantage of your
kind invitation.’”</p>

<p>“Oh! he said that, did he? But he won’t come.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but I have an idea that he will.”</p>

<p>“After all, you did well; there is always room in our
theatre, and the larger the audience we have, the more
they electrify the actors.&mdash;‘Je vais la revoir! Ha! ha!’&mdash;Tell
me what comes next.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose I know? You should learn
your part.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Tire out my brain and give myself a fever&mdash;I’m
no such fool; if I don’t know it, I’ll say the first
thing that comes into my head.&mdash;But Astianax and
Eolinde,&mdash;where are they?<a name="page_232" id="page_232"></a>”</p>

<p>“They are learning their parts, and it isn’t possible
to get near them!”</p>

<p>About noon, the actors began to arrive. There were
Dufournelle and his wife; the husband carried an enormous
bundle, for the ladies all brought their stage costumes
and their ball dresses. Next, Mademoiselle Polymnie
appeared with her father, Monsieur Camuzard, who
also carried a bundle; then Monsieur Mangeot and his
sister, each of them with a bundle.</p>

<p>“Why have you brought so many things,” said Glumeau,
“since Chambourdin promised the costumes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! catch us relying on Monsieur Chambourdin!”
said Madame Dufournelle; “I have made my
own costume; I have the part of a cook, and I have borrowed
my servant’s cap.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Camuzard, who was annoyed because no part
had been given to him, kept repeating:</p>

<p>“You will be very lucky if someone does not fail you
when it’s time to begin. On such an occasion as this,
accidents always happen, sudden indispositions, just as
they do at the theatre. I offered to take part, but they
didn’t want me.”</p>

<p>“But you are to prompt, you know, Monsieur Camuzard;
you prompt so well!”</p>

<p>“I am willing to prompt one play, but not three; that
is too tiresome.”</p>

<p>“I will prompt as many as you please,” said stout Dufournelle;
“don’t be afraid, I am solidly built, and my
breath won’t give out.<a name="page_233" id="page_233"></a>”</p>

<p>Monsieur Camuzard, seeing that the post of prompter
was about to escape him, hastily rejoined:</p>

<p>“After all, when I have got started, it won’t be any
more trouble to prompt all three plays.”</p>

<p>“Let’s rehearse, my friends, let’s rehearse, let’s not
lose any more time,” said Monsieur Glumeau. “The two
short pieces go well enough, but <i>Roderic et Cunégonde</i>
doesn’t go well at all. There is so much stage play.
Astianax, go and get the wooden swords, so that we may
rehearse the fights also.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect much company this evening?” asked
Madame Dufournelle.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so! A most select audience; I
have invited more than a hundred people, more or less;
journalists, artists; I don’t count the people of the village
and the neighborhood, who come to see the play.
When I don’t allow them to enter, they raise the devil;
they besiege the place and break down my trellis.”</p>

<p>“They represent the audience in the upper gallery in
the theatres in Paris; they are often the best judges of
the performance.”</p>

<p>“Astianax, did you ask your neighbor, Monsieur Jéricourt,
to come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa, and he will bring one of his friends, a
young man you would take for a tailor’s model, he is so
well dressed: Monsieur Arthur de Saint-Alfred&mdash;no, I
am wrong, it is Alfred de Saint-Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Saint-Arthur! Alfred! that gentleman must be a
humbug!<a name="page_234" id="page_234"></a>”</p>

<p>“I assure you, madame, that he is a very good-looking
fellow; at the theatre he never sits anywhere but in the
proscenium boxes!”</p>

<p>“As he never sits anywhere but in the proscenium,”
said Dufournelle, “he is necessarily a young man of very
high station.”</p>

<p>“Let’s rehearse, my friends, let us rehearse.”</p>

<p>“But we are not all here yet, young Kingerie and Monsieur
Fourriette the druggist are still missing.”</p>

<p>“I d&mdash;d&mdash;don’t want to f&mdash;f&mdash;fight with Monsieur
F&mdash;F&mdash;Fourriette!” said Mademoiselle Eolinde; “he
always hits me on the f&mdash;f&mdash;fingers with his sword.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is that he puts too much action into his
part; these druggists are generally very warm, especially
as they are almost always from the South. Why is
it that the South supplies more druggists and more
apothecaries than the North? That is a question I have
often asked myself. What do you say upon that point,
messieurs?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me easy enough to understand,” said
Monsieur Dufournelle. “It’s because sun dials are always
placed in the south.”</p>

<p>“Oh! excellent! excellent!”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand the joke,” said Monsieur Camuzard,
blowing his nose.</p>

<p>At last, Messieurs Kingerie and Fourriette appeared
on the road; the first, as awkward as ever, began by
upsetting a box of cactus which stood in a path where
there was much more room than he required. As for the<a name="page_235" id="page_235"></a>
druggist, a dark-haired, very good-looking youth, he was
all curled and perfumed, and made eyes at all the ladies,
to whom he did not fail to offer pastilles which he had
made himself.</p>

<p>“Take care, madame, take care,” said Dufournelle, “it
is very imprudent to accept monsieur’s pastilles; you
don’t know what he may have put in them! He is quite
capable of giving you something that will make you fall
in love with him.”</p>

<p>“If I knew that secret, I should not fail to make use
of it,” said Monsieur Fourriette, still offering his box
and smiling at the ladies.</p>

<p>“Well! I don’t care, I will take the risk!” said Mademoiselle
Mangeot, putting her fingers in the bonbonnière.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Mademoiselle Dufournelle in
an undertone, “that she isn’t the one who is taking the
risk at this moment!&mdash;Well, I will take the risk myself.”</p>

<p>“Let’s rehearse, my friends, let’s rehearse; just see
how the time is passing; let us go to the theatre at once,
we are all here.”</p>

<p>“All except the three robbers with speaking parts.”</p>

<p>“We will omit that scene.”</p>

<p>“And the child,&mdash;we must have the child, we must
make sure that he knows his part.”</p>

<p>“Astianax, go and fetch little Codinde, the gardener’s
son.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the gardener himself coming this way; he
looks as if he wanted to speak to you.<a name="page_236" id="page_236"></a>”</p>

<p>“The deuce! the fellow looks to me as if he had already
had a touch of sunstroke.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Pichet, the gardener, was in fact approaching
the company, and as he was quite conscious of the fact
that his legs wavered under him, he was walking very
slowly to maintain his equilibrium, and was trying hard
to keep his head back and his body upright.</p>

<p>“Pichet, go and get little Codinde, your son,” said
Monsieur Glumeau; “we want him for the rehearsal;
go at once.”</p>

<p>Instead of obeying his master and fetching Codinde,
the gardener tried to straighten himself up, and answered
in a thick voice:</p>

<p>“It’s impossible, monsieur; it’s impossible! Codinde
is just what I wanted to talk to monsieur about.”</p>

<p>“Can it be that anything has happened to him?”</p>

<p>“An attack of indigestion has happened to him; we
thought he was going to choke to death; he was purple.”</p>

<p>“The devil take you! Why do you stuff your son so’s
to make him sick?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t us, monsieur; the little glutton stuffs himself.
As there’s a celebration going on in the house, he
must have found lots of things to eat; bless my soul!
children, you know, they ain’t reasonable.”</p>

<p>“And then, too, you set him such an excellent example!”</p>

<p>“Why, monsieur&mdash;I haven’t eaten as much as your
thumb to-day, saving your presence.”</p>

<p>“No, but you have drunk enough to make up for it.<a name="page_237" id="page_237"></a>”</p>

<p>“I’ve drunk very moderate; besides, wine never upsets
me, I’m so used to it.”</p>

<p>“So, Pichet, your son won’t be in condition to act
to-night?”</p>

<p>“You had better not rely on him; the little rascal has
the fever and it don’t leave him a minute; it’s constantly
going and coming.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are in a fix; and it’s too late now to teach
anybody else Codinde’s part!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, if you say so, I can take my boy’s part
well enough; I know it, because I’ve been saying it to
him all day.”</p>

<p>“You, Pichet,&mdash;you take the child’s part?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Dufournelle, “in a play that is a parody
of the melodramas, it seems to me that it will be even
funnier to see the part played by a tall fellow like him.”</p>

<p>“Is that your opinion? Then I have no objection.&mdash;Can
we rely on you, Pichet?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I tell you that I know the part? The child is
hidden, the robbers come, and when he sees that they
are going to kill his father, he rushes at them like a kid.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, and he says to the robbers: ‘Messieurs,
in pity’s name, don’t hurt papa!’&mdash;Will you remember
that sentence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, I tell you I know it.”</p>

<p>“Then go and rest; don’t drink any more before this
evening, and be presentable when the time comes for the
play.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur will be satisfied with me.<a name="page_238" id="page_238"></a>”</p>

<p>The gardener walked away, as proud as a peacock to
play the part of a child, and the amateurs hurried to the
theatre, where they tried to rehearse as well as possible;
but while trying the combat with swords, which brought
the play to an end, young Kingerie, playing the part of
Malinot, and finding much difficulty in learning the <i>four
blows</i> which his adversary, Astianax, did his utmost to
teach him, unexpectedly invented a fifth blow which
landed on the nose of the son of the family.</p>

<p>Astianax shrieked, thinking that his nose was cut off.
The others crowded about him and reassured him; he
had suffered nothing worse than a swollen nose and a
slight cut upon it. Fourriette made haste to bathe the
wounded organ, and thought that with the aid of a compress,
which he urged the wounded youth to wear until
evening, the nose would resume its normal shape. But
young Kingerie was strictly enjoined not to use his sword
even for practice.</p>

<p>The dinner hour arrived, and with it four scene shifters
from one of the Parisian theatres, whom Glumeau had
hired to work the scenery on his stage. They were looking
for the theatre.</p>

<p>“What, have you hired men from the theatre?” cried
Dufournelle; “why, we would have set the scenes; we
would have acted as scene shifters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said Eolinde, “it’s very nice indeed when
friends manage all those things. We trusted it to them
once, and they never succeeded in setting the stage, except
the wings representing a cavern and the background<a name="page_239" id="page_239"></a>
of a salon; and they couldn’t light but two lamps, because
they had broken all the others.”</p>

<p>“What worries me is that Chambourdin doesn’t appear.
What shall we do?” said Glumeau, looking at his
feet. “I relied upon him, and I have no chevalier’s costume.”</p>

<p>“And he promised me, for the part of Roderic, the
costume of Robin Hood,” said Astianax.</p>

<p>“Ah! you should do as I do, messieurs,” said the druggist,
“and arrange your own costume for yourselves. I
have transformed myself into an Italian bandit, and you
must tell me what you think of him.”</p>

<p>“Does the action of the play take place in Italy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but what difference does it make, as
long as the costume is pretty?”</p>

<p>“Here he is!” cried Mademoiselle Eolinde; “a cabriolet
is stopping at the gate, and there’s a big bundle in
it. It’s Monsieur Chambourdin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is he; good! everything is all right,” said
Glumeau; “he is more prompt than usual.”</p>

<p>Chambourdin appeared with an enormous bundle of
costumes; there were helmets, cuirasses, tunics, long
boots, wigs, doublets, small clothes, in short, enough to
disguise the whole troupe. They all cheered, and carried
Chambourdin in in triumph; they even proposed to
embrace him, but he exclaimed that he preferred to dine.
Thereupon they hastened to the table, but stout Dufournelle
remarked that there was no need to hurry, because
the audience was not likely to come early, and because by<a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a>
eating too hastily the actors ran the risk of suffocating
on the stage.</p>

<p>Despite this advice, the ladies did hurry, and left the
gentlemen at the table, in order to try on their costumes.
The men took advantage of their absence to drink harder
and to give their tongues greater liberty. Dufournelle,
who had no part, made the champagne corks pop, saying:</p>

<p>“Come, messieurs, this will give you self-possession,
verve! If you’re a little tipsy, you’ll act much better!”</p>

<p>Young Kingerie, who realized the necessity of overcoming
his usual timidity, drank several glasses of champagne
in rapid succession, and soon his eyes began to
start from his head. Monsieur Camuzard drank in order
to prompt better; little Astianax, who for some time past
had affected very dissolute manners, proposed toasts to
the dancers at the Porte-Saint-Martin and to the bareback
riders at the Hippodrome. Chambourdin drank to
whatever anyone suggested. Monsieur Mangeot drank
to the success of the performance. Monsieur Glumeau
proposed his own health; and stout Dufournelle, saying
nothing, drank four times as much as the others.</p>

<p>But while drinking and laughing and talking, these
gentlemen forgot the time; and suddenly little Astianax
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! here are people coming already!<a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX<br /><br />
<small>A PLAY IN THE WOODS</small></h2>

<p>It was midsummer, when the days were longest; and
so, although it was nearly eight o’clock, the gardens were
not yet dark, and they could see outside the gate a large
number of persons who had come to see the performance.
The ladies were in full dress, because they knew that
after the play there would be dancing; the men too had
taken pains with their costumes; for while saying to
themselves: “In the country there is no ceremony;”
they were quite as anxious to please there as in the city.</p>

<p>“The devil! the devil!” said Chambourdin, ogling the
ladies who arrived. “Why, some of them are passably
good-looking. Who is that brunette, with high color and
her hair dressed <i>à la Fontange</i>? She has a saucy little
air which attracts me immensely. Is she a product of the
neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she belongs here, or at all events she has property
here.”</p>

<p>“Has she a husband?”</p>

<p>“She has one who is three times her age.”</p>

<p>“Then, it’s about the same as if she hadn’t any!”</p>

<p>“She is very gay, very fond of laughing; she rides and
fences and dances admirably.<a name="page_242" id="page_242"></a>”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! why on earth didn’t you give her a part in
the play, Monsieur Glumeau? I should have been delighted
to fence with her, to try the <i>four blows</i> with her.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau was no longer there; he had gone
to receive his guests; but little Astianax, made exceedingly
loquacious by the champagne, replied:</p>

<p>“My mother and sister aren’t very fond of Madame
Boutillon&mdash;that is the pretty brunette’s name; they say
that her manner with men is too free.”</p>

<p>“Oh! of course! that’s just like the women; when
one of them happens to be a little more lively, a little less
prudish, and doesn’t pick her expressions, but says
frankly what she thinks, why she is voted bad form at
once! she is too free! I snap my fingers at it; I like
them that way myself, and I will look after the little
Boutillon!”</p>

<p>“Ah! here is Miaulard, messieurs.”</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Miaulard; are you still hoarse?”</p>

<p>“I am getting better, much better.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say! you seem hardly able to speak
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the last time I couldn’t speak at all.”</p>

<p>“Ah! here is the baroness, messieurs, the famous
Baroness de&mdash;de&mdash;what’s her name?”</p>

<p>“De Grangeville.&mdash;What a beautiful dress!”</p>

<p>“What style! that woman must have been extremely
pretty once.”</p>

<p>“Ah! here is my friend Jéricourt, the literary man,
with Monsieur Alfred de Saint-Arthur.<a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>”</p>

<p>Astianax ran to meet his friend, who was already looking
about with a mocking air at the gardens and at the
people whom he saw in them.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, my dear neighbor; it is very kind of
you to have remembered my invitation.”</p>

<p>“I should have been very sorry not to accept it, my
dear Astianax; I am told that there is always much
entertainment at your house, and that the supper is
always excellent.&mdash;By the way, allow me to introduce my
friend, Monsieur de Saint-Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Highly flattered, monsieur; I have had the honor of
seeing you with monsieur.”</p>

<p>“True, we met on the boulevard.”</p>

<p>“At the booth of a pretty flower girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am not ashamed to say that I am one of her
admirers.”</p>

<p>“I was, but she has fallen infernally in my esteem,
since that day&mdash;you remember the occasion, Monsieur
Jéricourt?”</p>

<p>“Oh! very well, indeed; but after all, why should that
make any difference to you? The flower girl is none
the less pretty.”</p>

<p>“Of course not! But, you see, I thought that she was
innocence personified.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” cried the dandified Saint-Arthur, trying
to stuff the head of his cane into his nose, “the idea of
a flower girl being a model of virtue! That would be
the eighth wonder of the world.&mdash;But where is your
theatre, monsieur?<a name="page_244" id="page_244"></a>”</p>

<p>“You will see it in a moment.&mdash;But I see my mother
and sister; I will introduce you, messieurs.”</p>

<p>“That long bean-pole is his sister,” whispered Saint-Arthur
in Jéricourt’s ear.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear fellow, and I don’t advise you to give
her your arm, you would look like her doll!”</p>

<p>“Never fear, I haven’t any desire to do it. What a
pity that Zizi isn’t with us! I see that there will be plenty
to laugh at here. How she would enjoy it! I fancy that
we shall find their comedy decidedly ridiculous! But
what are they going to do with all the chairs they are
taking out of the garden? Are they moving?”</p>

<p>“Those are the seats being taken to the theatre,” said
Madame Glumeau, graciously saluting the two gentlemen,
who, although they had just arrived, were already
busily engaged in making sport of whatever they saw;
“seats for the spectators, I mean. It would be very kind
of you, messieurs, to help a little, to take a few chairs into
the wood.”</p>

<p>“What an astonishing woman!” murmured the dandified
Saint-Arthur, turning to Jéricourt; “as if we came
here to carry chairs!”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Alfred, be decent, or I won’t take you
into the country again. Look about; there are some very
pretty women here, and I sacrifice myself,&mdash;I am going
to carry some chairs.”</p>

<p>The garden began to fill with guests, some from Paris,
others who lived in the neighborhood. The darkness was
coming on, and the semi-obscurity added to the charm<a name="page_245" id="page_245"></a>
of the occasion. Some ladies, by chance or by design,
had wandered away from their husbands, whom they
were careful not to find again; but gallant cavaliers zealously
offered their arms, to assist them in their search.</p>

<p>Chambourdin did not fail to take advantage of the
opportunity to approach Madame Boutillon; the pretty
little brunette had lost no time in losing her husband very
soon after her arrival, and the bald young man hastened
to offer her his arm, saying:</p>

<p>“You are looking for monsieur your husband? accept
my arm, madame, and I’ll guide you; I know the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am not looking for my husband at all, monsieur,”
replied the little lady, laughing; “I am not afraid
that he will get lost.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that makes a difference; pray come into the
woods, madame; I will take you to the theatre and find
you a seat.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, monsieur.”</p>

<p>At that moment, Madame Glumeau walked toward the
gate with a large number of ladies, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Come to the woods, messieurs, everybody to the
theatre; we must take seats, for it will begin very soon.”</p>

<p>The company followed Madame Glumeau to the enclosure
facing the stage. All the seats were very soon occupied,
but most of the men took their places behind, and
leaned against the trees. The creaking of the trellis work
which enclosed the auditorium indicated that there was
also an audience outside, which proposed to enjoy the
spectacle although uninvited.<a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a></p>

<p>The male actors dressed in the billiard room, the ladies
in the house. As they were about to begin, they discovered
that various indispensable accessories were lacking;
thereupon there was much running from the theatre
to the house, and from the house to the theatre; one saw
nothing but people hurrying back and forth, shouting:</p>

<p>“The basket! we must have a basket!”</p>

<p>“And the letter for Monsieur Astianax!”</p>

<p>“And a table! we must have a table, and a cloth on it!”</p>

<p>“We want a stove,&mdash;where’s the stove?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t one; take an empty cask, that will represent
a stove well enough!”</p>

<p>“We must have a pie! there’s a supper in the play.”</p>

<p>“Take an empty flower pot, that will do very well for
the pie.”</p>

<p>“We want a bottle of champagne.”</p>

<p>“There’s a bottle of Seltzer behind the first wing;
that will pop like champagne.”</p>

<p>All these incidents delayed the rising of the curtain;
but the audience did not grumble, they laughed and
found amusement in all that they saw. At last an
amateur musician armed with a violin, and another carrying
a clarinet in his arms like a baby, took their seats
in front of the stage.</p>

<p>As for the prompter, there being no hole under the
stage for him, he stood behind the drop curtain.</p>

<p>“This theatre in the midst of a forest is really very
pretty!” said Madame de Grangeville, who was seated
beside Madame Glumeau.<a name="page_247" id="page_247"></a></p>

<p>“Oh! you will see how pretty it is, madame la baronne,
when the curtain rises; we have some lovely scenery:
a Pompadour salon, painted by Monsieur Devoir; it is
perfectly lovely.”</p>

<p>“What plays are they going to give us?”</p>

<p>“They begin with <i>Œil et Nez</i>, a little farce acted by
Madame Dufournelle, my son and Monsieur Mangeot.&mdash;But
it is very strange,&mdash;look about as I will, I don’t
see Madame Boutillon; and yet I am very sure that she
came with her husband.”</p>

<p>“Who is Madame Boutillon?”</p>

<p>“She is a young lady who lives here in summer, as we
do; she had on a very original, very pretty dress.”</p>

<p>“If she has on a pretty dress, it isn’t possible that
she has hidden herself; she must be somewhere here.”</p>

<p>“But no, I can’t see her.”</p>

<p>“Hush! they are beginning.”</p>

<p>The three knocks were given. The amateur with the
violin started off and played the overture to Fra Diavolo;
the clarinet started a few measures later, and played
the overture to Jeune Henri; the two men played thus
for some time, seeing who could go the faster, persuaded
that they would finally overtake each other and play together.
The audience opened their ears in amazement,
but the wiser ones stuffed theirs.</p>

<p>“Sapristi! what on earth are they playing?” murmured
a native, looking at his neighbor, who answered in
an undertone:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it’s a terrible mixture.<a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a>”</p>

<p>At last the violin stopped, but the clarinet went on.</p>

<p>“We are not playing the same thing, that isn’t right!”
cried the violinist, waving his bow.</p>

<p>The clarinet refused to listen; he went on with his
<i>Jeune Henri</i>. Luckily the curtain rose, the actors came
on the stage; but as the clarinet kept on, they were
obliged to rush upon him and snatch his instrument away.</p>

<p>The little farce would have gone very well if Madame
Dufournelle had laughed less, and if Monsieur Mangeot
had looked less often at the prompter, which, by the way,
did him no good, because Monsieur Camuzard, who filled
that post, having drunk too freely of the champagne,
found his mouth so dry that he could hardly speak, and
passed his time turning over the play-book, and saying
to the actor who was waiting for his lines:</p>

<p>“Wait till I find the place; I can’t find it; we have
time enough; they won’t ask for their money back!”</p>

<p>Luckily the actors did not follow this advice, and
despite the prompter, the first play, which was very
amusing, came to an end amid the applause of the spectators.</p>

<p>As soon as the first play was at an end, Madame Glumeau
rose, in order to make further search for Madame
Boutillon, whose husband was chatting tranquilly with a
group of men who had gathered on the outskirts of the
audience.</p>

<p>“As her husband is there, the lady must also be in the
audience, unless she has gone on the stage; she is quite
capable of it.<a name="page_249" id="page_249"></a>”</p>

<p>“I say! look at that lady sitting on the branch of a
tree!” cried the clarinet at that moment to his neighbor
the violin. “There’s an idea for you! if the branch
should break, we should see some fine things.”</p>

<p>“That is she! that is Madame Boutillon!” said Madame
Glumeau, looking at the person who had deemed it
advisable to adopt that position.</p>

<p>Chambourdin, who had taken the little brunette’s arm
on the pretext of finding her a good place to see the play,
had in fact led her into the wood, of which he knew every
nook and corner; but instead of taking her toward the
stage, he had taken her in the opposite direction, and had
soon found himself with Madame Boutillon in the deserted
paths, where they could hardly see their hands
before their faces, for lanterns had been placed only in
the paths leading to the theatre.</p>

<p>The little brunette, noticing somewhat tardily that her
guide was not taking her toward the company, and that
he held her arm as if he proposed to waltz with her,
chose to stop, saying:</p>

<p>“Where on earth are you taking me, monsieur? I
can hardly see anything here.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference, madame; don’t be afraid
I’ll lose my way; I’m like a cat, I can see in the dark.”</p>

<p>“But I am not like a cat, monsieur, and I prefer to
walk where it is light; we did not take the path leading
to the theatre.”</p>

<p>“We shall arrive there all the same this way; all
the paths lead there.<a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a>”</p>

<p>“This must be the longest one.”</p>

<p>“With you, madame, the longest will always be the
shortest.”</p>

<p>“That is very polite of you; but don’t hold me like
that, I beg.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we should waltz a bit?”</p>

<p>“You are mad! the idea of waltzing when we can’t
see!”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference; on the contrary, you get
less dizzy.”</p>

<p>“Really, monsieur, you have some very original ideas;
but I want to see the play, and you will be responsible,
monsieur, for my not finding a seat.”</p>

<p>“As for that, madame, I will undertake to give you
one of the best places.&mdash;Come, madame.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you shall not lead me astray again, monsieur;
that isn’t the way to go, this is the way.”</p>

<p>The little brunette chose the right road this time, and
refusing to listen to Chambourdin, she arrived in front
of the stage at last; but as she had anticipated, all the
chairs were occupied.</p>

<p>“Well! what did I tell you, monsieur? Come, show
me that excellent seat which you reserved for me.”</p>

<p>“This way, madame; I will show you.”</p>

<p>And Chambourdin led the young lady to an enormous
chestnut, the branches of which reached out a long way,
forming a thousand odd figures.</p>

<p>“See, madame, do you want a really good seat? Look
at this tree; this first branch, which is very low, will<a name="page_251" id="page_251"></a>
afford you a chair, yes, an armchair, for the branches
behind seem placed there expressly for a support. As for
the strength of the branch, you need have no fear, it
would bear fifteen people like you. From there, you will
overlook everybody, and will have an infinitely better
view than all the ladies in the chairs. Will you allow
me to put you up there, madame? Nothing could be
easier; I will make a step for you.”</p>

<p>Madame Boutillon roared with laughter at the suggestion
of her escort; but as she was a very original person
herself, and as she was especially fond of making herself
as whimsical as possible, she accepted the suggestion
and replied:</p>

<p>“All right, monsieur, give me a back, and let me climb
up to my box.”</p>

<p>The young man at once obeyed, offering his hands
and his shoulders. That method of climbing a tree was
slightly risqué for a lady, and all the men who witnessed
the scene envied the opportunity of the one who acted as
Madame Boutillon’s ladder; but she mounted so rapidly,
and turned about in the tree with such aplomb, that everybody
applauded her ascent. Chambourdin remained
standing near the pretty brunette, who used his shoulders
as a bench to rest her feet upon; and not for anything on
earth would he have abandoned his position.</p>

<p>Madame Glumeau, who had turned toward the chestnut
tree, called to Madame Boutillon:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu, madame! what on earth are you doing
there? What an idea to climb up into that tree!<a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a>”</p>

<p>“I did it to have a good view of the play, madame;
all the seats below were taken, and I love to have a good
place.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, come down, Madame Boutillon!
I will give you my chair, and find another. Come, you
can’t stay up in the air.”</p>

<p>“Why not, pray? I don’t see that I am in anybody’s
way; and as I am perfectly comfortable, I propose to
stay here.”</p>

<p>“She is an extraordinary creature!” said Madame
Glumeau, turning to the people near her. “She always
wants to do differently from others!”</p>

<p>“If that lady desires to put herself in evidence,” said
Madame de Grangeville, “it seems to me that she couldn’t
have a better place.”</p>

<p>The mistress of the house left her seat for a moment,
and approached the group of which Monsieur Boutillon
was one; she made her way to the old gentleman’s side
and said to him:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Boutillon, do look at your wife, sitting on
the branch of a tree! I am afraid some accident will
happen to her. Tell her to get down. I have begged her
to but she won’t listen to me.”</p>

<p>“What! what! Is that my wife up there?” replied the
husband, looking into the air. “Oh! that doesn’t surprise
me; she has always been fond of climbing trees;
she’s a regular squirrel, is Zéphirine! She is strong, and
yet she is very light. One day, at a village fête, she insisted
upon climbing a greased pole. She put on trousers,<a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a>
and she would have reached the prize, if they hadn’t
torn, so that she had to come down! We had a good
laugh over it!”</p>

<p>“But Monsieur Boutillon, if madame should fall,&mdash;it
isn’t probable that she has put on trousers to come here
to dance.”</p>

<p>“No matter! never fear, I’ll answer for everything.”</p>

<p>“If the husband answers for everything, madame,”
observed Jéricourt with a mocking expression, “it seems
to me that you have no right to worry!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and stand by the chestnut tree, Jéricourt,”
said little Saint-Arthur, leading his literary friend away.</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear Alfred, you are a sad rake! you want
to see the foliage upside down!&mdash;Well, I will let you take
me where you will.”</p>

<p>As she returned to her seat, Madame Glumeau saw
her son rush into the woods with an air of dismay,
crying:</p>

<p>“Miaulard! Miaulard! where’s Miaulard?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Astianax? you look all upset.
What do you want of Monsieur Miaulard?”</p>

<p>“Why, we want him to take Kingerie’s place. Just as
we were ready to begin <i>Il y a plus d’un Ane à la Foire</i>,
we noticed that Kingerie wasn’t on the stage; we called
him and hunted everywhere for him; at last Dufournelle
heard groaning from the direction of the pond; he ran
there and found that Kingerie had fallen in. It seems
that he had remained at the billiard room to dress, and
discovered that he was late; thereupon he started to<a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a>
run, and didn’t remember that there was a small pond
in the woods; so he fell into it.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word! did he do it on purpose? A pond
that isn’t ten feet in circumference! Did he find a way to
drown himself in it, too?”</p>

<p>“No, he couldn’t have done it if he had wanted to;
there isn’t three feet of water; but the champagne he
had drunk&mdash;everything together made him sick; he is
in no state to act, and Miaulard must take his place.&mdash;Tell
the audience to be patient.&mdash;Miaulard! Miaulard!”</p>

<p>Madame Glumeau returned to her seat and informed
the company of the accident that had happened to one of
the amateur actors, and requested indulgence for the one
who was to take his place. This little speech at an end,
the mistress of the house was on the point of resuming
her seat, when she saw a gentleman standing against a
tree a little apart from the company, and apparently engaged
in passing in review the assembled guests.</p>

<p>“Ah! I was very certain that he would come, myself,”
said Madame Glumeau, sitting down beside Madame de
Grangeville. “It’s a great favor that he does us, for
hitherto he has refused every invitation; he hasn’t been
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Of whom are you speaking, madame?”</p>

<p>“Of one of our neighbors, named Monsieur Malberg,
who owns a fine estate near ours, and who has the reputation
of living like a bear, of never seeing anybody.
But he makes a very good appearance, none the less.”</p>

<p>“Where is this bear of yours?<a name="page_255" id="page_255"></a>”</p>

<p>“Over yonder, at the right. Turn a little and you can
see him at your ease; he isn’t looking this way now.”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville followed the indication that
Madame Glumeau had given her and soon she saw Monsieur
Malberg, who was quite alone, evidently determined
to hold himself aloof from the assemblage, at
which he was looking as if he were seeking someone there.</p>

<p>The baroness’s eyes rested upon him; she seemed unable
to remove them, and as she gazed at him, her features
altered, her face became ghastly pale, and her whole
person betrayed the most profound agitation. Madame
Glumeau did not observe her neighbor’s confusion, because
she was talking with the violin and the clarinet
players, who proposed to play something to beguile the
tedium of the intermission; but, luckily for the audience,
the signal was given and the second play soon began.</p>

<p>Madame Glumeau gently nudged her neighbor, who
was still looking toward the right, and said:</p>

<p>“They’ve begun, they’ve begun. You’ll see my husband
act now, he has a very important part; he is
splendid in it; he cuts a thousand capers. My daughter
and my son act also, and the play is very well mounted!”</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville did not seem to hear what
Madame Glumeau said, for she continued to look toward
the right, apparently paying no attention to the stage;
but suddenly she turned her head and resumed her
former position; it was because Monsieur Malberg had
looked in her direction and she had not dared to meet
his glance.<a name="page_256" id="page_256"></a></p>

<p>The second farce was <i>enlevé</i>, as they say on the stage.
The substitution of Miaulard for young Kingerie did not
injure the play in the least. The former being extremely
hoarse, nobody heard him speak, which made it unnecessary
for him to know his part. But it was noticed that
Monsieur Glumeau, who had danced his part through
three-fourths of the play, was much less animated toward
the end.</p>

<p>After the farce, as they expected a long intermission,
to prepare the scenery for the important play and to give
the actors time to change their costumes, there was a
general movement among the audience. The men went
to walk in the woods, to smoke their cigars, the ladies
gathered in groups to chat, and some of them also walked
away under the trees, where they were frequently heard
laughing heartily,&mdash;for what reason, nobody knew.</p>

<p>“This idea of a theatre in the woods is very original,”
said Jéricourt to his friend Alfred; “really I did not
imagine that it would be so amusing. Come, Saint-Arthur,
let us take a turn around the theatre to look at
it all at close quarters. Do you intend to stay planted
by this chestnut tree? Why, my dear fellow, it would
do no good for you to shake the tree, the lady won’t fall
like a plum; besides, she has a cavalier at her feet, who
doesn’t seem inclined to lose sight of her.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I should climb the tree myself?”</p>

<p>“Ah! that would be one way of approaching the lady,
it is true; but reserve that until a little later, wait until
the last play begins.<a name="page_257" id="page_257"></a>”</p>

<p>The little dandy allowed his friend to lead him on the
stage, where they did not find a single actress, those ladies
having gone to dress; but by way of compensation, they
saw the young druggist in the costume of Détroussandos,
chief of bandits, who was rehearsing his part, his battles,
his manœuvres, with Miaulard, the latter having undertaken
also the rôle of Malinot, which the unfortunate
Kingerie was to have played in <i>Roderic et Cunégonde</i>.</p>

<p>Monsieur Fourriette’s costume consisted simply of
flesh-colored tights, over which he had drawn a very
short pair of red and black bathing drawers, a jacket,
a belt, and a broad-brimmed gray hat with the brim
turned down.</p>

<p>“The deuce! there’s a brigand who proposes to show
how he is built,” said Jéricourt.</p>

<p>“Is not my costume pretty, messieurs?” asked the
druggist, addressing the two young men, whom he recognized
as persons to whom he had several times sold pills
and other preparations.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s Monsieur Fourriette; I didn’t recognize
you. So you are to act in the next play, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, messieurs, I take the part of Détroussandos,
the brigand; I am rather well dressed, eh?”</p>

<p>“In other words, you are not dressed at all; your costume
is exceedingly indecent.”</p>

<p>“In what respect, pray? I have on tights&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, but so tight one wouldn’t think you wore any.”</p>

<p>“So much the better; at all events, I have drawers&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_258" id="page_258"></a>”</p>

<p>“Which don’t reach half way down your thighs.”</p>

<p>“Messieurs, I love accuracy in everything; this is the
true costume of the Italian brigand.”</p>

<p>“It is lucky that you are not to act in the Creation of
the World; you would be capable of representing Adam
in the costume of that day.”</p>

<p>“Faith! it would be more exact.”</p>

<p>“I like to think that you will have a cloak at least.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have one, but I shan’t put it on; I shall
simply carry it on my arm.”</p>

<p>“You evidently mean to make conquests.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I saw a little lady just now up in a tree&mdash;<i>fichtre!</i>
messieurs, such a pretty brunette! such a lovely
bird!&mdash;Come, Monsieur Miaulard, let’s rehearse our fight
with swords. One, two, up; three, four, down!”</p>

<p>“I say, messieurs, it isn’t certain that we shall give
the play, after all,” said Monsieur Mangeot, appearing in
his hermit’s costume, with a huge piece of cotton batting
pasted to his chin, which imitated a white beard to perfection.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Has some other actor fallen into the pond?”</p>

<p>“I insist upon it’s being emptied at once, so that we
shan’t have any more of that.”</p>

<p>“No, messieurs, it isn’t that, no one has fallen into
the pond; only Kingerie was capable of such a masterpiece
as that; but Monsieur Glumeau is complaining,
and says that he doesn’t know if he will be able to act.<a name="page_259" id="page_259"></a>”</p>

<p>“Bah! what’s the matter with him now?”</p>

<p>“You probably noticed that when he was playing Pincette
just now, he was in delightfully high spirits at
first, and did nothing but jump and pirouette; he sang
all his lines, standing on his toes; he was a regular
zephyr. But toward the end, as he attempted to pirouette
from one end of the stage to the other, although it isn’t
very large, it seems that he caught a stitch in his side;
he must have twisted himself, or strained some nerve, or
perhaps much less than that; but you know Monsieur
Glumeau&mdash;he thinks he’s dying on the slightest provocation.
Ever since then he has been very anxious, he goes
limping about, holding his side; he wants to be rubbed
every minute, and he’s afraid of inflammation.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t they give his part to Chambourdin?”</p>

<p>“Chambourdin! We can’t even count on him to play
one of the robbers. He is standing almost under the
skirts of a lady who is seated on the branch of a tree.
Just now I called out to him: ‘Come and put on your
robber’s costume!’ and he answered: ‘I am here at madame’s
orders, and bayonets won’t make me leave.’”</p>

<p>“Sapristi! we must give the play all the same!” cried
the druggist, who was most anxious to exhibit himself in
tights; “doesn’t monsieur feel able to take the part impromptu?”</p>

<p>The druggist addressed this question to little Saint-Arthur.
The young dandy, always keenly desirous to
produce a sensation, was attracted by the suggestion and
exclaimed:<a name="page_260" id="page_260"></a></p>

<p>“Do I wear a handsome costume?”</p>

<p>“You dress as you please.”</p>

<p>“Pardieu! in that case, I like the idea, and I accept;
but, as I shan’t have time to learn the part, I will act in
pantomime.”</p>

<p>“An excellent idea,&mdash;as good as that of giving <i>La
Dame Blanche</i> without music.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Saint-Arthur, are you really going
to act?” asked Jéricourt.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I have an idea of a costume that will leave
Fourriette’s in the shade! I am going to cover myself
with leaves.”</p>

<p>But at that moment they heard young Miaulard shouting:</p>

<p>“Victory! here comes Monsieur Glumeau in his tyrant’s
costume, messieurs; that means that he will act.”</p>

<p>“See how he hobbles along and leans over on one
side!”</p>

<p>“That won’t do any harm in his part; he will suggest
Ligier in <i>Richard the Third</i>, at a distance.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Glumeau came on the stage, saying in a most
affecting manner:</p>

<p>“Ah! my friends, I don’t know whether I shall be able
to play; this infernal pain doesn’t leave me; it’s terrible!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t anything, Monsieur Glumeau&mdash;a strained
muscle.”</p>

<p>“Or perhaps it’s only wind, a gust of wind that has
lodged there.<a name="page_261" id="page_261"></a>”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? Ten thousand bombs! if I only
knew that!”</p>

<p>“I am not at all anxious to stand beside him!” muttered
Miaulard, walking away.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s ready,” said little Astianax, muffled up
in a cuirass and buckler and helmet, and brandishing a
lance which was twice as long as himself. “Where is
my sister, where is Cunégonde?”</p>

<p>“Here I am!” cried Mademoiselle Eolinde, dressed as
a Malabar widow. “I have my p&mdash;p&mdash;part at the end of
my f&mdash;f&mdash;fingers.”</p>

<p>“Let us begin then.”</p>

<p>“One moment!” said Monsieur Glumeau; “before we
begin, I want to drink a glass of anise water; someone
has gone to fetch it for me.”</p>

<p>“What is going to happen, great heavens? what is
going to happen?” exclaimed Miaulard, walking still
farther away from Monsieur Glumeau.</p>

<p>At last, in place of anise water, they brought Monsieur
Glumeau some anisette; he drank two small glasses
of it and consented that the play should begin. The
signal was given. The amateur musicians executed a
polka which would pass very well for the overture to a
melodrama. The curtain rose, and applause burst forth
on all sides; the audience was delighted with the scenery;
no curtain had been hung at the rear, and the veritable
forest, lighted here and there, produced a magical effect.
And then the odd costumes of the actors heightened the
enthusiasm of the audience. The hermit’s cotton beard,<a name="page_262" id="page_262"></a>
the chevalier’s helmet, the vizor of which persisted in
falling over young Astianax’s nose, the wooden swords
and daggers, everything, even to the dragging gait and
foolish expression of the tyrant, combined to enchant the
spectators; but when the young druggist appeared as
Détroussandos, when he strode across the stage with
his tights surmounted by drawers, bursts of laughter
arose in every direction, and the little lady who was seated
on the branch of a tree was seized with such a paroxysm
of hilarity that several times, as she squirmed about, she
almost fell; luckily Chambourdin was still in his place,
ready to restore equilibrium over his head.</p>

<p>The play proceeded amid general applause and hilarity,
until the scene between the child and the robbers who
proposed to kill Roderic. The gardener was said to be
at his post; and in fact Master Pichet had not forgotten
that he was to take his son’s place; but instead of remaining
sober as he had been urged to do, the gardener
had considered, on the other hand, that in order to act
with spirit, and to avoid any feeling of timidity before
the audience, it would not be a bad idea to get a little
tipsy; and what the peasant called getting a little tipsy,
was drinking so much that he could hardly stand on his
legs. In that condition Monsieur Pichet had gone upon
the stage, and had hidden himself behind the trees from
which he was supposed to keep an eye upon the robbers.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget your lines,” said Eolinde: “‘Oh! for
heaven’s sake, messieurs, don’t hurt papa!<a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a>’”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know the lines! Don’t you be afraid, mamzelle,
I don’t know anything else!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the famous scene was reached; Détroussandos
and two robbers held their swords over Roderic’s
head, and the child did not appear to prevent them from
striking.</p>

<p>“The child! the child! <i>sapredié!</i> send on the child!”
exclaimed Astianax in an undertone.</p>

<p>“What on earth is that brute doing?” muttered Fourriette,
still holding his sword in the air; “is he going to
leave us like this for long?”</p>

<p>The gardener did not appear, because when he was
once seated behind the trees, he had instantly fallen
asleep; stout Dufournelle, who was prompting and who
heard him snore, ran to him and shook him roughly by
the arm, shouting:</p>

<p>“It’s your turn! it’s time for you to go on! wake up,
corbleu!”</p>

<p>The gardener, waking with a start, rubbed his eyes,
sprang to his feet, ran on the stage, and threw himself
into the midst of the robbers, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Ah! you villains! you loafers! you mean to beat
our young master, do you? Just wait a bit, and I’ll show
all three of you something! You’ll see how I do it!”</p>

<p>And with that, falling upon the druggist and the two
young men dressed as robbers, the gardener began to distribute
fisticuffs and kicks which were not included in
the action of the play; the three actors, who did not
anticipate that attack, began to shout and yell, and ended<a name="page_264" id="page_264"></a>
by returning the gardener the blows that they received;
this combat, which the audience supposed to be feigned,
was greeted with unanimous applause, and Monsieur
Boutillon cried:</p>

<p>“Faith, I have often been to the theatre, but I must
confess that I never saw such a good imitation of a fist
fight as this!”</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX<br /><br />
<small>A SILENT INTERVIEW</small></h2>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry of: “It’s raining, here comes
the storm!” among the spectators; instantly all the
ladies, fearing for the welfare of their dresses, rose in
haste and ran toward the house. Madame Glumeau,
while regretting that they could not wait for the end of
the play, abandoned her place, saying to the ladies who
were near her:</p>

<p>“Come, follow me; I will show you the shortest way,
and we shall soon be at the house.”</p>

<p>The general movement that took place among the
spectators put an end to the combat which was in progress
on the stage. Monsieur Glumeau ordered his gardener
to go home to bed, and he suggested to the actors that
they should follow the example of the audience and return
to the house. The young druggist declared that the<a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a>
shower would not last, and that they might finish the
play; but no one listened to him, they all ran toward the
gate leading from the wood. Madame Boutillon said to
Chambourdin:</p>

<p>“Help me down.”</p>

<p>“Drop,” replied the advocate.</p>

<p>The little brunette followed his injunctions so closely
that for some moments Chambourdin was unable to extricate
his head, which was covered by the lady’s skirts.
But when his head reappeared, he had such a triumphant
expression that one would have thought that his hair
had grown. Like everybody else, in a moment he disappeared
with Madame Boutillon, and the little wood
which a few minutes before rang with shouts of laughter
and the merry quips of a numerous company, would have
been entirely deserted, had not two persons remained
without stirring in the places that they occupied, apparently
regardless of the storm and not thinking of following
the departing crowd.</p>

<p>Monsieur Malberg, who up to that time had avoided
society and had not accepted any invitations from his
neighbors, had departed from his usual habit in going
to Monsieur Glumeau’s; but it will be remembered that
he was very anxious to meet Monsieur de Roncherolle,
of whose return to Paris he had been informed. The
search made by Georget had led to no result, and Monsieur
Malberg had said to himself:</p>

<p>“If I want to find him, to meet him anywhere, I shall
not succeed by staying at home and avoiding society.<a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a>
Roncherolle used to love dissipation and conviviality, so
that I must seek him in society.”</p>

<p>The result of these reflections was his acceptance of
his neighbor Glumeau’s invitation. However, as he still
found it difficult to lay aside his habits, we have seen
that, instead of mingling with the guests, Monsieur Malberg
had held himself a little aloof; but from his position
he could easily scrutinize the whole company, especially
the men, almost all of whom were standing behind
the ladies; and he had satisfied himself that the man
whom he sought was not there.</p>

<p>Thereupon, his eyes had wandered in the direction of
the ladies; he could see only the backs of those who occupied
the front rows of seats, and Madame de Grangeville
was one of them; so that he was looking, without
paying any particular attention to them, at the ladies of
the company, who, however, were very handsomely
dressed, when one of them, Madame de Grangeville,
turned her head and looked in his direction. Monsieur
Malberg was struck by that glance; a thousand memories
awoke in his mind; but the lady turned her head away
almost immediately, and he could not see her features.
Impelled by curiosity, however, to know that person,
a single glance from whom had so disturbed him, he
had quietly left his place and had drawn nearer to the
stage, without, however, mingling with the audience,
until he was so placed that, without being seen, he could
at his leisure examine the lady who was seated beside
Madame Glumeau.<a name="page_267" id="page_267"></a></p>

<p>On scrutinizing the baroness closely, Monsieur Malberg
had thought at first that he had made a mistake;
nineteen years had caused so many changes! And all
of us have a singular habit: if we are many years without
seeing a woman, when we think of that woman, we
always imagine her as she was when we saw her last.
Instead of saying to ourselves: “Time must have
marched with her; her beauty and charm and freshness
must have undergone deplorable changes;” we always
imagine that she is as we left her, because her image, her
figure, her bearing charmed us so, and because the heart
and the memory shrink from attributing age to the objects
whose souvenir they cherish.</p>

<p>And so, while gazing attentively at Madame de Grangeville,
Monsieur Malberg said to himself:</p>

<p>“No, I am mistaken, it isn’t she, it cannot be the
woman whose grace, whose fresh complexion and slender
figure and light step everyone admired; and yet, those
are her features; despite the deep wrinkles at the corners
of her mouth, that is the lower part of her face; her
eyes are black-ringed and swollen, but the expression is
still the same, and it is that expression which has awakened
all my memories. Her face is thinner, her hair has
changed its color; there are wrinkles on her brow; and
yet I cannot doubt it; it is she! yes, surely she! And, in
truth, over nineteen years have passed since I saw her;
but I had not thought that she could grow old!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Malberg could not remove his eyes from
the baroness after that; he abandoned himself the more<a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a>
freely to that mute contemplation, because no one could
observe it.</p>

<p>When the first drops of rain set the whole company in
motion, Monsieur Malberg did not stir from his place;
he still continued his observation, curious to see what
the lady upon whom he kept his eyes fixed would do.
She had remained as if glued to her chair; she had
heard Madame Glumeau urge the guests to follow her,
but she had paid no heed; having no fear whatever of
the storm which everybody else seemed to dread, she remained
in the woods, exposed to the rain; and when the
whole company had fled toward the house, she was still
there, not daring to turn her head in the direction in
which she had seen her husband; for in Monsieur Malberg
she had instantly recognized the Comte de Brévanne,
whom she had married long before.</p>

<p>The part of the wood in which they were was still
lighted by the lamps on the stage and by the lanterns
placed at intervals in the enclosure reserved for the audience.
But the rain had extinguished some of the lights,
the wind swung the lanterns to and fro so that the light
that remained was as uncertain as the weather, which,
however, had not become so bad as they had feared;
the rain, which had fallen at first with considerable violence,
had already diminished, and the wind, which had
aroused such terror, seemed also to have abated.</p>

<p>“Why does she stay there alone? Why didn’t she
follow all those people? What is the reason that she
remains exposed to the rain? She is in a ball dress. Can<a name="page_269" id="page_269"></a>
she have seen me? No, I was standing aloof; and if she
had seen me, she would not have recognized me; time has
passed for both of us alike, and I had to examine her a
long time to be certain that it was she.”</p>

<p>Such were the reflections of the man whom we now
know to be the Comte de Brévanne, but whom we shall
call Malberg more than once, because we have become
accustomed to it.</p>

<p>The count, however, was mistaken in thinking that
his wife had not recognized him; in the first place,
ladies have a glance which carries much farther than
ours; and then time, which had wrought such changes
in her, seemed to have treated her husband with respect;
in fact, as he had very strongly-marked features, and a
face which had always been serious, even grave, he had
seemed older than he really was when he might still
have been ranked with young men; and so time had aged
him less, and except for his hair, which had turned gray,
and for some few deep wrinkles on his forehead, he had
changed very little. So that Madame de Grangeville had
recognized her husband in the person whom Madame
Glumeau had pointed out as Monsieur Malberg; a single
glance had sufficed to make her certain of the truth.
Then she had sat a long while without turning her head;
she hoped that her husband did not see her, and yet
she was burning with the longing to know if he had seen
her. As a woman is not in the habit of resisting curiosity,
she turned her head once more in the direction where
the count was; it was then that their eyes met; in despair<a name="page_270" id="page_270"></a>
because she had shown herself, and having no doubt
that her husband had recognized her, Madame de Grangeville
wished that she were a hundred leagues away; and
yet, when she sat trembling in her chair and the other
guests had left the wood, she was so perturbed that she
had not strength to walk, and she was utterly at a loss
what course to pursue.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed after all the others had gone.
Nothing could be heard in the woods except the patter
of the raindrops on the leaves. Madame de Grangeville
gathered her shawl about her shoulders as if she were
cold; she dared not turn her head to see if she were
alone, and yet she said to herself:</p>

<p>“He must have gone away with the others; it isn’t
probable that he has remained here. Why should he?
If he recognized me, as I think, he must have been all the
more eager to go. Oh, yes! I am very sure that he has
not gone to Monsieur Glumeau’s house. What a fool
I am to tremble like this! but I can’t help it; I had so
little expectation of this meeting, after so many years!
It is strange! he has hardly changed at all; he still has
the same serious look; he is still&mdash;Ah!”</p>

<p>As she spoke thus to herself, she slowly turned her
head, to make sure that there was no one behind her, and
she saw her husband standing motionless against a tree,
with his eyes still fixed upon her.</p>

<p>Thereupon she felt her blood run cold, she was almost
terrified. And yet there was nothing terrifying in the
Comte de Brévanne’s eyes; they expressed amazement<a name="page_271" id="page_271"></a>
rather than anger; but she upon whom they were fixed
instantly turned her own away, feeling that she had not
courage to endure their gaze.</p>

<p>“He is there, still there! he doesn’t take his eyes
from me!” said Madame de Grangeville to herself; not
daring to move or to turn her head. “Mon Dieu! what
can be his purpose? It seemed to me that he was glaring
savagely at me!”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t dare to move; no doubt I frighten her!”
said the count to himself; “I will go away. I can understand
that my presence is not likely to produce a pleasant
impression upon her. I must go; she is not the one
whom I sought here.&mdash;Great heaven! how she has
changed!”</p>

<p>The count was preparing to go away, and had already
taken several steps, when he heard a dull sound, resembling
a prolonged groan, apparently very near the
stage.</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! what is that?” cried Madame de Grangeville.</p>

<p>The count stopped to listen; the same groan made
itself heard again, even more distinctly.</p>

<p>Madame de Grangeville, terror-stricken, uttered a
shriek, left her chair, and no longer fearing to look at
her husband, turned her eyes in all directions, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! in pity’s name, will no one come to help
me?”</p>

<p>But her eyes sought in vain the Comte de Brévanne;
he had disappeared under the trees, uncertain as to what<a name="page_272" id="page_272"></a>
he ought to do, but desirous to learn the cause of the
strange noise he had heard.</p>

<p>At that moment, voices arose in the distance and came
rapidly nearer. Little Astianax, jovial Chambourdin,
young Miaulard and Beau Saint-Arthur were coming in
search of the baroness; for when all the guests had assembled
in the salon, that lady’s absence had been noticed;
and as Madame Glumeau declared that she had been in
the woods, her failure to return caused apprehension that
some accident had happened to her, and that the little
pond had done further execution.</p>

<p>The four gentlemen entered the wood, shouting with
all their strength:</p>

<p>“Madame de Grangeville!”</p>

<p>“Madame la baronne!&mdash;Are you here?&mdash;Has anything
happened to you?”</p>

<p>“Answer, please!”</p>

<p>“This way, messieurs, this way; yes, I am here!”
the lady made haste to reply, overjoyed by the arrival of
the young men. “Come, come, messieurs! come! mon
Dieu! how opportunely you arrive!”</p>

<p>“But, madame, how does it happen that you remained
alone in the wood? You did not follow the crowd, the
torrent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, messieurs, I didn’t follow the other ladies at
first, because I had lost my&mdash;my handkerchief; it is quite
a fine one and I stopped to look for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if we had known that, madame, we would have
saved you the trouble. Did you find it?<a name="page_273" id="page_273"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have it; but then, as I was about to leave this
spot, I had a fright, I heard a noise that terrified me so
that I was too weak to walk when you arrived.”</p>

<p>“The deuce! what can it have been?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t probable that there are robbers in our wood,”
said little Astianax.</p>

<p>“It would be strange, at least, that they should have
selected the day when it was full of people to come here,”
said Chambourdin.</p>

<p>“Unless,” said Miaulard, “they are robbers who are
very fond of a play, and who were unable to resist the
desire to see the fine performance going on here!”</p>

<p>“<i>Fichtre!</i> if <i>I</i> had acted!” muttered young Saint-Arthur.</p>

<p>“You are pleased to jest, messieurs, but I believe that
I still hear the noise which frightened me just now.&mdash;Yes,
there it is; listen.”</p>

<p>The young men ceased to speak and did in fact hear
the prolonged groan.</p>

<p>“Parbleu! we will find out what that is!” said Astianax,
arming himself with a chair.</p>

<p>The others did the same, except Saint-Arthur, who
deemed it prudent to return to the gate. Miaulard took
down a lantern, and they went in the direction from which
the noise came; they speedily discovered the gardener
lying at the foot of a tree; he was asleep, but his sleep
was greatly disturbed, for he groaned and muttered:</p>

<p>“Ah! the villains! In pity’s name, don’t hurt papa!&mdash;Here,
take that, you!<a name="page_274" id="page_274"></a>”</p>

<p>The young men returned to Madame de Grangeville,
laughing heartily, and told her what had caused her
terror.</p>

<p>“It’s the actor who dealt blows in earnest,” said
Chambourdin. “He is so full of his subject, that even
when sleeping off his wine, he fancies that he is acting
still.”</p>

<p>“Let us go back to the company and allay their
anxiety,” said Astianax, offering Madame de Grangeville
his arm. “Come, madame; I trust that nothing
more will interrupt the pleasures of the night.”</p>

<p>“Faith,” said Chambourdin, “we are all in excellent
mood to enjoy ourselves, to dance. Even Monsieur Glumeau,
who seemed not to feel well when he was playing
his tyrant’s rôle, is recovering all his agility and high
spirits; he no longer has a stitch in his side.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed that,” muttered Miaulard; “the
anisette has produced its due effect.”</p>

<p>The young men returned to the house with the lady
they had found in the woods, and the Comte de Brévanne,
who had been an invisible witness of all that had happened,
returned home, still saying to himself:</p>

<p>“How she has changed!<a name="page_275" id="page_275"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI<br /><br />
<small>ON THE BOULEVARD</small></h2>

<p>Since Monsieur Malberg had gone to live at Nogent-sur-Marne,
Georget, having no errands to do for him,
had plenty of time to see the pretty flower girl and to
talk to her; when she scolded him because he did not
work, the messenger would reply with a sigh:</p>

<p>“Bless me! mamzelle, it isn’t my fault if no work
comes to me! I certainly don’t refuse any, and although
I am very happy with you, I often regret that I don’t earn
more money during the day&mdash;not for myself, for I always
have more than I need, but for my mother, whom I would
like to make more comfortable.”</p>

<p>Georget meant what he said, for when he saw his
mother persist in sitting up late, in robbing herself of
sleep in order to earn a few sous more, he thought of the
happy life he might have provided for her, of that life,
free from hard labor and from care, which would have
been hers if he had accepted Monsieur Malberg’s offer;
and that thought often clouded his brow; as he gazed at
the pretty flower girl, he sometimes blamed himself for
loving her, because he felt that that love had been fatal
to his love for his mother.<a name="page_276" id="page_276"></a></p>

<p>One morning, the young fellow waited in his usual
place, looking in the direction of Violette’s booth, from
which she had been absent for some time. Georget was
more melancholy than usual; in the first place because he
could not see the object of all his thoughts, and secondly,
because he had earned nothing as yet that morning, and
his mother had had a very scanty supper the night before.</p>

<p>Soon he noticed a young man pacing back and forth
in front of Violette’s booth, and recognized in him the
little fellow with the squint, whom he knew to be one of
the flower girl’s adorers. Monsieur Astianax was sauntering
along the boulevard, with an enormous cigar in his
mouth, which he was very proud to be smoking, and the
smoke of which he seemed to take pleasure in blowing
into the faces of the ladies who passed; a method of attracting
attention which did not fail to be very agreeable.</p>

<p>Suddenly another young man, somewhat older, came
toward little Glumeau; they met and stopped just in
front of Georget, who, seated upon his stool, with his
head in his hands, seemed to be asleep.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s young Astianax Glumeau!”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Monsieur Chambourdin; so you are
not at the Palais?”</p>

<p>“At the Palais! Why should I be, if you please,
young man?”</p>

<p>“Why, to plead; I thought that an advocate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am an advocate only in the <i>Gazette des Tribunaux</i>.
I publish little articles there which I invent for the
pleasure of the subscribers. I plead at my leisure, in my<a name="page_277" id="page_277"></a>
office, before my desk, and I am never called to order;
that is the way I understand the advocate’s profession.
But you, my beardless youth, how does it happen that
you are not in the country with papa and mamma? For
I presume that your dear parents are still there? In
such lovely weather, it is good luck to be in the shade
and fresh air!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my parents are down at Nogent, and that is
just the reason that you find me strolling on the boulevard!
Ha! ha! when the parents are in the country I
am my own master here; I do just what I choose!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I understand you, you young rascal; we have
some little intrigues on the carpet. You are right, it is
never too early to begin to make one’s way in the world.
If I had a son, I would say to him: ‘Sow your wild
oats early; in that way, you will have less to sow later.’&mdash;What
do we need in order to be virtuous? experience;
and to have experience, we must have lived! How is
that for logic? Doesn’t that smell of Cujas and Barthole?&mdash;And
dear papa is well, I trust? The stitch in
the side hasn’t come back?”</p>

<p>“No, but he has a constant itching on the sole of his
foot just now.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! all he has to do is to scratch.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t very convenient to scratch the sole of your
foot; you can’t do it while you’re walking. You know
my father&mdash;it makes him anxious, he’s afraid that it’s
some humor.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s an idea! He has chilblains, that’s all.<a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a>”</p>

<p>“I went to friend Fourriette, the druggist’s; he’s
making something for father to put on his feet.”</p>

<p>“An excellent way to bring on a disease where there
isn’t any.&mdash;But no matter, you gave us a delightful party!
The play, although it wasn’t finished&mdash;or perhaps because
it wasn’t finished&mdash;was very amusing. And the ball and
the supper! <i>Fichtre!</i> we did go it!”</p>

<p>“I say, what about that young lady that you perched
on a branch; it seemed to me that you were very attentive
to her.”</p>

<p>“Madame Boutillon? Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity that you fell when you were waltzing with
her.”</p>

<p>“I did it on purpose; it’s a stratagem I invented, to
make a woman become attached to me!”</p>

<p>“Why? because you throw her down while waltzing?”</p>

<p>“To be sure; when she feels herself falling, she
clutches me, she clings to me, and squeezes me as tight as
she can! Do you understand, young man, what intimate
relations that brings about between us?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, that’s true.”</p>

<p>“Just try it, my dear fellow; take my advice, ask a
lady to waltz, then fall with her; and tell me what you
think of it.”</p>

<p>“Shall I fall underneath or on top?”</p>

<p>“Underneath is more polite; but on top is more
rakish.”</p>

<p>“I will remember that; and at the first ball I go to, if
I see a lady who takes my eye, I will ask her to waltz.<a name="page_279" id="page_279"></a>”</p>

<p>“The rest will go all alone!”</p>

<p>“And that method served with Madame Boutillon?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I tell you that it’s infallible?”</p>

<p>“And you call on that lady now?”</p>

<p>“To be sure; I play cards with her husband; we play
Pope Joan; he’s very fond of it.&mdash;And you, little
Astianax&mdash;whom are you looking for on the boulevard?
are you expecting to meet some one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am expecting some one, who seems in no hurry
to come.”</p>

<p>“You have an appointment on the boulevard, at the
flower market? That is very pleasant; you walk amid
agreeable odors. Ladies often make their appointments
at the flower market.”</p>

<p>“No, I have no appointment; I came here because I
am in love with a little flower girl; and very pretty she
is! Ah! she beats Madame Boutillon, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“That is very possible! I never thought that Madame
Boutillon could not be beaten.&mdash;Where does your lovely
flower girl stand?”</p>

<p>“Over yonder, opposite us&mdash;that booth where there is
no one just now. She has probably gone to carry a bouquet
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“How goes your love-affair? have you triumphed?”</p>

<p>“I have not triumphed yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So your flower girl is a model of virtue, an untamed
beauty, is she?”</p>

<p>“A model of virtue! Oh! I thought so for a long
while. When I found how cruel she was, I fancied that<a name="page_280" id="page_280"></a>
Violette&mdash;that is her name&mdash;I fancied that Violette was
virtuous; but I was mistaken; I was a blockhead; the
flower girl is not cruel with everybody, I have a proof
of it. She does her work on the sly!”</p>

<p>Georget, who had not lost a word of the conversation
between the two young men, sprang to his feet like a
flash, and planting himself in front of Astianax, said to
him, glaring at him with eyes inflamed by wrath:</p>

<p>“You lie! you insult Violette! just because she refuses
to listen to you! But you are nothing but a slanderer,
do you hear?”</p>

<p>Little Glumeau was thunderstruck; he rolled his eyes
about in all directions, and utterly failed to understand
that apostrophe which fell from the clouds upon him;
but Chambourdin, who was perfectly calm, stepped between
Astianax and Georget, and said to the latter:</p>

<p>“Why do you put your oar in, my boy? Who spoke
to you? Why do you presume to interfere in our conversation?
Are you a spy, that you busy yourself listening
to us? The deuce! you are beginning that trade
very young!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Astianax, beginning to recover from
his surprise; “what does this mean? whom is this little
<i>voyou</i>, this blackguard, talking to?”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t insult me, monsieur, or I’ll punch your
head; I am a messenger, a respectable young man!”</p>

<p>“Once more,” retorted Chambourdin, “we don’t know
you; why did you listen to what monsieur was saying
to me?<a name="page_281" id="page_281"></a>”</p>

<p>“Why did you stop and talk right in front of me? I
should have had to stuff my ears to keep from hearing.
Still, I didn’t pay much attention to your words, until
monsieur began to talk about Mademoiselle Violette the
flower girl; then I listened with all my ears, it is true,
because it interested me, because I know Mamzelle Violette,
because I know that she’s an honest girl, who
doesn’t listen to what men say to her, when they try to
induce her to make a fool of herself; and you said that
she wasn’t cruel to everybody, that she wasn’t virtuous,
that she wasn’t a model of virtue! You lied, and I
couldn’t listen to that without saying something, for I
should have been a coward if I had heard you insult
Violette without taking up her defence.”</p>

<p>“It seems that this is another lover of the flower girl,”
said Chambourdin, turning toward Astianax to laugh;
but the latter had turned as red as a rooster, and he said
to Georget:</p>

<p>“I might send you to the devil; but I am willing to
answer you. I didn’t lie in what I said about the flower
girl. No, I didn’t lie, I said nothing that I’m not sure of.
No, Mademoiselle Violette isn’t virtuous; for girls who
mean to remain virtuous aren’t in the habit of calling on
young men who live all alone.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that Violette has been to your
house?”</p>

<p>“No, not to mine! but to the rooms of a young man
who lives on the same landing that I do,&mdash;his door is
just opposite mine.&mdash;I say, Monsieur Chambourdin, it’s<a name="page_282" id="page_282"></a>
Monsieur Jéricourt the author, who came to our party at
Nogent with a friend of his, who was dressed so
nicely&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That he looked like a tailor’s manikin.&mdash;Oh! I remember
those two gentlemen perfectly!”</p>

<p>Georget, who had turned pale at the mention of Jéricourt’s
name, said to Astianax:</p>

<p>“I too know the gentleman you speak of; I have seen
him often enough come here and play the gallant with
Mamzelle Violette; but she has never listened to him, and
it was he who lied when he told you that she had been to
his room.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t need to tell me anything, because I saw,&mdash;do
you hear?&mdash;because I saw the pretty flower girl come
out of his room.”</p>

<p>“No, no! you made a mistake; it wasn’t her, it
couldn’t have been!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have made a mistake, for I know her perfectly
well, and she passed close to me.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t her, I say.”</p>

<p>“Ah! this is too much! What if I should tell her so
when she returns, in your presence&mdash;then would you believe
me, young messenger?”</p>

<p>“You would dare to tell her that&mdash;her?”</p>

<p>“Why should I hesitate, as it’s the truth?”</p>

<p>Georget seemed completely upset, he was pale and agitated,
and did not know what to think.</p>

<p>“Come, come, my poor boy,” said Chambourdin, “I
see that you too are daft over this flower girl, who is very<a name="page_283" id="page_283"></a>
fascinating, it seems; but after all, perhaps it’s a great
service that my young friend does you, by opening your
eyes with respect to this girl. You credit her with all the
virtues, because you are in love with her; that is easily
understood, you are so young! but that is a common
thing; oh! these women! they are very fragile! When
five years more have passed over your head, I should
like to hear what you say about them.”</p>

<p>Georget said nothing more, but Astianax exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The flower girl has returned to her place, and I am
going to talk with her. Monsieur Chambourdin, come
in that direction, as if by accident, and bring this fellow
who doesn’t choose to believe me; in a moment you will
know if I have said anything other than the truth.”</p>

<p>“I have no objection,” said Chambourdin; “indeed
I ask nothing better than to approach the flower girl; she
is enchanting, and I believe that I am falling in love with
her too!”</p>

<p>Little Astianax walked for some distance among the
booths and shrubs, for it was flower market day on Boulevard
Saint-Martin; then he approached Violette with
an indifferent air and began to look at her flowers. The
girl, recognizing the little man with the squint, acted as
if she did not see him and kept on making a bouquet.</p>

<p>“All these flowers are lovely! they are all as fresh as
you are!” said Astianax at last, vexed because the flower
girl paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>“Does monsieur want another bouquet that speaks?”
said Violette with a mischievous expression.<a name="page_284" id="page_284"></a></p>

<p>“No, mademoiselle; you see, I have found out that
there is no need of that to make myself understood; it
is much better to say myself what&mdash;what I have already
said to you several times: that you are maddeningly
beautiful, and that I adore you!”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I assure you, monsieur, that it tires me
to hear the same thing over and over again.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it tires you, does it?” retorted the little man,
assuming an impertinent tone. “Indeed! that’s a great
pity! But still I am not inclined to stop. Why should
I lose courage? You are not so unkind as you choose
to appear; as you have been sensible to the attentions of
others, why should you not become so to me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, monsieur, but once
more I beg you not to talk this way to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! don’t pretend to be angry like this, my lovely
flower girl; it won’t go down with me again. Have you
forgotten that I saw you coming out of Monsieur Jéricourt,
my neighbor’s? I live on his landing. Oh! you
were tremendously agitated, and well rumpled when you
left his room.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur! what you say is outrageous!”</p>

<p>“Outrageous! Do you mean to say that I lie? Will
you dare to say that it isn’t so?”</p>

<p>Chambourdin and Georget, who were only a few steps
away, had overheard everything. The young messenger
could no longer contain himself; he ran forward and
stood in front of Violette, pale and trembling, with blazing
eyes, and said to her in a broken voice:<a name="page_285" id="page_285"></a></p>

<p>“So it is true! so it is true, as you don’t deny it!”</p>

<p>The flower girl, greatly surprised at Georget’s sudden
appearance in front of her, was embarrassed for a moment,
and stammered at last:</p>

<p>“Well! if it was so, is that any reason for speaking
to me like this?”</p>

<p>“The question is decided!” muttered Chambourdin,
addressing Georget; “you see, my little innocent, that
my friend did not lie!”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is frightful! I would never have believed it!
And my mother, my poor mother, whom I sacrificed
for her! The good Lord is punishing me for it.&mdash;Adieu,
Mademoiselle Violette! I will never speak to you
again!”</p>

<p>Having said this, Georget ran off like a mad man, and
speedily disappeared.</p>

<p>Violette looked after him, and tears gathered in her
eyes; she turned to young Astianax, and said to him
simply:</p>

<p>“Are you quite satisfied with what you have done,
monsieur?”</p>

<p>Astianax lowered one eye and raised the other, then
took Chambourdin’s arm, saying:</p>

<p>“Let us go.”</p>

<p>Chambourdin glanced once more at the girl, who tried
to conceal her tears with her flowers, and he said to his
companion:</p>

<p>“She isn’t of the same style of beauty at all as Madame
Boutillon, but she pleases me greatly, none the less.<a name="page_286" id="page_286"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII<br /><br />
<small>A BOTTLE OF ABSINTHE</small></h2>

<p>Georget ran home to his mother without stopping,
without drawing breath; he found her sewing, snatched
her work from her hands, and threw it aside, saying:</p>

<p>“Drop that, mamma, don’t work any more, don’t tire
your eyes any more; hereafter you will be able to enjoy
yourself, to be happy, to walk about all day long. Oh,
yes; you are going to be very happy, I tell you! Pack
up your things quick, we’re going away.”</p>

<p>Honest Mère Brunoy gazed at her son in surprise, utterly
unable to understand what he said; but his wild
manner, his excitement, frightened her, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Georget? what has
happened to you, my boy? You’re not in your usual
condition.”</p>

<p>“It’s joy, mother; yes, it’s pleasure, I tell you, good
fortune; that upsets a man a little, but I shall get used
to it; I will make the best of it and not think of her
any more.”</p>

<p>“You will make the best of your good fortune! you
won’t think of her any more! I don’t understand at all!
You talk of joy and of pleasure, and you have tears in<a name="page_287" id="page_287"></a>
your eyes, and you are as pale as death! Do you know
that you don’t look at all like a person who brings good
news?”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, mother, I am very happy; for I
tell you again, you won’t need to ruin your eyes any more,
to wear yourself out working.”</p>

<p>“How is that, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Because Monsieur Malberg&mdash;you know, that gentleman
on the third floor who is so kind to us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; well?”</p>

<p>“Well, we are going to his house in the country&mdash;both
of us, mother, both of us. Yes, I will go with you
and settle down there; I won’t leave you any more; I
won’t come to Paris any more&mdash;never! never! oh! I
have a horror of Paris!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, my boy? Monsieur Malberg has offered
you a place at his country house, too?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, to be sure; I am to look after the workmen,
to take care of his garden and plant it; there are
eight acres of it&mdash;that’s a pretty good-sized garden, eight
acres! He told me that I should be at liberty to arrange
it all as I pleased; and you, mother, you will have charge
of the house, the linen, the furniture, the poultry yard;
and he will give us a thousand francs a year for it.”</p>

<p>“A thousand francs! Mon Dieu! why that is a
fortune, my boy! It means that our future is provided
for; you will not be a messenger any more. We won’t
spend the thousand francs; we will save up money to
buy you a substitute when you are drafted! For that<a name="page_288" id="page_288"></a>
is what I am always thinking about.&mdash;And was it only
just now that that generous man offered to employ you
at his country house?”</p>

<p>“Just now&mdash;oh, no! It was a long time ago, mother.
If you knew&mdash;but I won’t keep it from you any more;
you shall know what a bad son I have been; but you
will forgive me, when you know the cause. Mon Dieu!
it was too much for me!”</p>

<p>“You, a bad son, Georget; no, that is impossible; you
do yourself an injustice, my child!”</p>

<p>“No, for all this comfort that I offer you to-day,
Monsieur Malberg proposed to me some time ago, when
I spoke to you about going to his country house; it depended
only on me to go there then with you, and I did
not tell you that, because then I could not make up my
mind to leave Paris; for&mdash;mon Dieu!&mdash;for I was in love&mdash;there!
that is what I had at the bottom of my heart,
and did not dare to tell you!”</p>

<p>“Is it possible! you in love already! Why, you won’t
be eighteen for two months.”</p>

<p>“Still I have been in love a long time.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy! then that is the reason why some days you
were so sad and other days so gay! Lovers always go
to extremes!&mdash;And it’s all over now, is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! it’s all over, mother; I don’t propose to
think of her any more; I don’t propose to see her, either,
for if I should see her, I should treat her as she deserves;
but that wouldn’t do any good, that wouldn’t prevent&mdash;what
has happened. You see, mother, I believed that<a name="page_289" id="page_289"></a>
she was so virtuous, I would have gone into the fire for
her, and she deceived me.”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you that she loved you, my boy?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t tell me so, except with her eyes,&mdash;at
least it seemed to me that I could read it there. But I
deceived myself, no doubt! However, let us not talk
any more about her, mother, let us not talk any more about
her. Pack up your things, take only what you need for
a little while, and later I will come back and fetch the
rest; the most important thing now is to go.”</p>

<p>“But, my boy, our furniture, and these lodgings&mdash;we
haven’t given notice.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about all that, we will give it later.
While you are getting ready, I will go and ask Baudoin,
the concierge, if Monsieur Malberg is at his country
house now.”</p>

<p>Georget left his mother and ran quickly down to the
concierge. Baudoin was keeping the lodge, for his wife
had drunk so much the night before that she had been
taken ill, and was not in condition to leave her bed.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Baudoin, could you tell me if Monsieur
Malberg is at his house at Nogent now, or if he is living
here?” Georget asked as he entered the concierge’s lodge.
That functionary, who was in very ill humor at being
obliged to serve as his wife’s nurse, swore like several
carters and said as he poured water into a cup:</p>

<p>“Herb tea! I think I see myself making her herb
tea, the miserable drunkard! Water is what she needs,
to put out the fire that she keeps kindled in her insides!<a name="page_290" id="page_290"></a>”</p>

<p>“Will you answer me, please, Monsieur Baudoin?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Monsieur Georget, you see a man sorely vexed,
sorely humiliated by his social position. My wife is my
shame, I am not afraid to say so; she behaves like the
lowest of the low! Just fancy, monsieur, that one of
the chief clerks in my department&mdash;you know that I am
employed in a department?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are an office boy.”</p>

<p>“Boy! good God! I wish I was a boy! But it’s true
that they call us office boys although we are married;
and the day before yesterday one of my superiors, who is
satisfied with my intelligence, made me a present of a
bottle of absinthe,&mdash;as an extra&mdash;genuine Swiss absinthe,
a liqueur that I am very fond of. So I came home with
my bottle, but I took pains to tear off the label, and to
say to Hildegarde, whose vicious tastes I know too well:
‘Don’t touch this bottle, don’t think of tasting what there
is in it; it’s Chinese opium, and it would put you to
sleep right away; but you’d never wake up.’&mdash;‘All right,
that’s enough,’ said Hildegarde; ‘but I don’t see why
you take it into your head to bring poison here.’ At that
I says to her: ‘If I choose to do it, it’s none of your
business, as I’m the master.’ Then she made some impertinent
remark, I administered a healthy punishment,
and we went to bed on it. Yesterday morning I started
for my office as usual; I was delighted with my trick,
and I said to myself that my absinthe was in no danger.
Well, monsieur, I returned at night and what did I find?
My bottle empty, no absinthe&mdash;Hildegarde had drunk it<a name="page_291" id="page_291"></a>
all, all, monsieur, and hadn’t left me a drop! That is
what I can never forgive&mdash;I didn’t have a taste of it myself!
As for my wife, you can judge what a state she
was in, and when I undertook to reprove her, if she didn’t
have the cheek to answer: ‘It’s your fault, you villain,
I poisoned myself on purpose; I wanted to get away
from your hard treatment; but you lied&mdash;your poison
doesn’t put a body to sleep, and it ain’t bad at all, and if
there was any more, I’d take another drink.’</p>

<p>“That, Monsieur Georget, is what the wretched creature
dared to say to me; and to-day she is on her back,
she can’t move, and I like to think that she’ll never get
over it!”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s a wicked thing to say, Monsieur Baudoin&mdash;to
wish for your wife’s death!”</p>

<p>“It’s for her good, as she will not mend her ways.”</p>

<p>“But I beg you, tell me if Monsieur Malberg is at his
country house or in Paris now?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Malberg&mdash;why, I don’t know myself; but
wait, he must be in Paris, for I saw his blackamoor going
upstairs just now; indeed I believe he was carrying a
bottle in a wooden case&mdash;you know the kind of bottle I
mean; what there is inside must be fine!”</p>

<p>Georget lowered his head sadly, saying to himself:</p>

<p>“If Monsieur Malberg is in Paris now, we can’t go
to his country house without his permission, without
finding out whether he still wants us; but I would have
liked to start to-day, for if I stay in Paris I can’t do
otherwise than go out on the boulevard.<a name="page_292" id="page_292"></a>”</p>

<p>“I say, Monsieur Georget,” continued the concierge,
“if you want, I’ll go up to Monsieur Malberg’s and I’ll
ask his yellow negro if his master is here.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if you would have that kindness, Monsieur
Baudoin, I should be very much obliged to you!”</p>

<p>“With pleasure. I am not sorry to leave the lodge
for a minute. If that creature asks for drink, give her
water; she don’t like water and it’s a punishment for
her.”</p>

<p>Baudoin went up to the third floor, and Georget remained
in the lodge, absorbed, not in his thoughts, but
in a single thought; for it was impossible for him to
think of anything else than Violette’s going to Monsieur
Jéricourt’s room. The concierge was absent a long time,
but at last he came downstairs again, swearing as usual.
“Ten thousand cursed names! how can a man take
such animals as that into his service? They are brutes,
and nothing else!”</p>

<p>“Well, Monsieur Baudoin, is Monsieur Malberg in
Paris?”</p>

<p>“Just imagine, Monsieur Georget; I rang the bell
upstairs,&mdash;I was very sure that there was someone there;
however, it was a long while before anybody opened the
door; I rang again and the black fellow appeared at last.
‘Is your master here just now?’ I asked him. That
vagabond of a Ponceau began to laugh and showed all
his teeth&mdash;I must admit that all colored men have extremely
white teeth; probably it’s the white that their
skin lacks. I asked my question again, and the slave<a name="page_293" id="page_293"></a>
answered, shaking his head violently: ‘No, no, no,
master not here! Me here with Broubrou, Babo, and
Zima; me come to fetch Zima!’&mdash;As I didn’t understand
what he meant with his Broubrou and his Babo, I said to
him: ‘But I didn’t come to ask for you.’&mdash;With that
he made a face at me and left me there, and went back
into the salon. But I heard him talking and jabbering;
you would have sworn that there were two people disputing.
That is what makes me think that the negro lied
when he said that his master wasn’t in, for it couldn’t
be anybody else that I heard him talking to.”</p>

<p>Georget, understanding only vaguely what Baudoin
told him, concluded that he would do better to go up to
Monsieur Malberg’s himself, and learn what to expect.
He wiped his eyes and left the lodge, without answering
the concierge, who asked him if his wife Hildegarde was
still breathing.</p>

<p>Pongo opened the door to the young messenger and
leaped for joy when he saw him.</p>

<p>“Ah! Monsieur Georget! he nice boy, he come to
see Pongo.”</p>

<p>“My dear Pongo, Monsieur Malberg is the one I
would like to see; it is he that I have business with; is
he in Paris?”</p>

<p>“No, no, me tell concierge so. Big fool, he no understand;
he stand there like a stick.&mdash;Master, he in the
country, in the pretty house, at Nogent.”</p>

<p>“He is at Nogent? Oh! I am glad of that, for then
I can go there, I can take my mother there! Monsieur<a name="page_294" id="page_294"></a>
Malberg, who is so kind to us, offered me employment
there long ago, and work for my mother; I refused then,
but to-day I have decided to go; my mother is packing,
and she must have finished by this time; but I don’t
know what road to take to go to Nogent; can you tell
me, Monsieur Pongo?”</p>

<p>“You, go to Nogent? Then you come with me. Me
going back right away to master with Mamzelle Zima,
what we forgot. Poor Zima! Her not like not to be in
the country. Oh! me very glad if you coming, Monsieur
Georget! You will see what a pretty place it is!
Lots of fruit, fine garden, pretty flowers! Carabi, he
play a lot down there; he grow big like a ball! You go
fetch your good mother, and we start right away! I
beat Broubrou, Babo, and all the little rugs! Dem nice
and clean now. Me all ready.”</p>

<p>“I will go and bring my mother and our bundles.”</p>

<p>“Oh! me go up with you, carry all that! The mother,
her never carry nothing.”</p>

<p>And the mulatto, without listening to Georget’s thanks,
went up with him to the attic and took possession so
quickly of all the bundles prepared by Madame Brunoy,
that she had no time to remonstrate; Pongo was downstairs
before the good woman had closed her door.</p>

<p>The three travellers passed the concierge’s lodge;
Baudoin, who stood in the doorway, heaved a deep sigh
as he said to them:</p>

<p>“God forgive me! I believe the wretched Hildegarde
will recover!<a name="page_295" id="page_295"></a>”</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br /><br />
<small>IN THE FRESH AIR</small></h2>

<p>When they entered the charming little house at Nogent
which belonged to the Comte de Brévanne, Georget’s
mother uttered an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.
In truth, it was difficult for anyone who loves the country
not to be overjoyed to live in such a lovely spot. The
house, which was quite modern, had only two floors, and
at the top a fine terrace, surrounded by vases filled with
flowers. But each window had an artistically carved
balcony, with railings of the finest workmanship.</p>

<p>In front of the house a beautiful lawn with a border
of orange trees, afforded a pleasant relief to the eye.
And on each side, broad paths of lindens afforded during
the hottest weather a promenade where the sun was
not allowed to penetrate.</p>

<p>Georget himself, despite the painful thoughts which
oppressed his heart, could not remain indifferent to all
the beauties which nature lavished about him. Those
majestic trees, those flower-laden shrubs, that green
lawn, the balmy air, everything appealed to his senses;
he felt a sort of alleviation of his pain, his brow brightened,
and for the first time since his departure from Paris,
he looked with interest at his surroundings.<a name="page_296" id="page_296"></a></p>

<p>“What! are we going to live here?” cried Georget’s
mother. “Why, it isn’t possible! it’s too beautiful!
This house is a regular château! I shall never dare to
go into it.”</p>

<p>“This not all,” said Pongo; “you’ll see the garden,
the orchard, the kitchen garden, fine fruit, big cabbages,
nice sweet little peas&mdash;we have everything! And then
the poultry yard&mdash;little chickens, pigeons, ducks, turkeys!
Oh! me like roast turkey!”</p>

<p>“This place is a kind of paradise on earth.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Pongo, it would be very kind of you to go
to your master and tell him that we have come, and ask
him if he still wants us; for perhaps he may have different
ideas now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he want you! he want you! Me go tell him;
look, me see him over there in the garden; me run and
take him Mamzelle Zima, to make him pleased. Wait,
wait!”</p>

<p>The mulatto left his travelling companions, to tell his
master of their arrival. Georget remained with his
mother, who continued to admire all that she saw, and
walked along the paths with great caution, as if she were
afraid of leaving her footprints there. But from time to
time she glanced at her son, who had relapsed into reverie.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t seem to notice his sadness,” she said to
herself; “it will pass away. At his age, it isn’t possible
that it will resist distractions, and we shall have enough
of them here! A month from now I will wager that he
won’t give a thought to his love-affair in Paris!<a name="page_297" id="page_297"></a>”</p>

<p>The Comte de Brévanne, notified by Pongo, soon appeared
to receive the new arrivals; he greeted Madame
Brunoy kindly, and she outdid herself in reverences;
then he tapped Georget on the shoulder, and said to him:</p>

<p>“Well! so we have changed our mind, have we? We
are willing to live somewhere else than in Paris now?”</p>

<p>Georget, who was deeply moved, and seemed constantly
on the point of weeping, replied in a trembling
voice:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I am very glad, monsieur, very happy
now to come here to live with my mother; that is to
say, if you care to take us both.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my boy, my intention is still the same;
I take back nothing of what I said and I am very glad
to have you settle in my house; I trust that you won’t
repent having come.”</p>

<p>“O monsieur!” cried Mère Brunoy, with more reverences,
“is it possible not to be happy here? It seems
to me that I have grown ten years younger already since
we have been here. Mon Dieu! such a lovely house!
Monsieur may be sure I’ll do my best to satisfy him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Georget, struggling to master his emotion,
“we will work all the time; in the first place, I
wish to show monsieur that I am not a lazy fellow; I
mean to employ my time better than in Paris, for in
Paris I loafed sometimes, but that will not happen again;
I shall never go back to Paris. Monsieur won’t make me
go there, will you, monsieur? You will allow me to stay
here all the time, won’t you?<a name="page_298" id="page_298"></a>”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Brévanne, who had noticed Georget’s excitement,
smiled slightly as he replied:</p>

<p>“All right, my boy, we will talk about all those things
hereafter; but go now with your mother and take possession
of your quarters. Pongo will escort you.&mdash;Pongo!
the small building at the left, near the entrance
to the kitchen garden&mdash;that is where Madame Brunoy
and her son are to live.”</p>

<p>While Georget and his mother followed the mulatto,
who went before them, dancing a sort of chika and singing:
“Me going to see Carabi my friend! oh! he not
naughty any more, he going to lick my nose!” the
Comte de Brévanne entered one of the avenues lined
with linden trees, and as he walked back and forth there,
seemed buried in profound meditation. Within a few
days, the mood of the man whom his neighbors called
the Bear had changed considerably: Monsieur de
Brévanne was still pensive, but his reverie was less
gloomy, less forbidding than before; his brow had
cleared, he avoided society less, and it even happened
sometimes that he stopped to talk a moment with his
neighbors. This abatement of his misanthropy dated
from the day that he had seen his wife in Monsieur Glumeau’s
wood.</p>

<p>The count had been walking there for some time,
when he spied Georget standing within a few feet of him,
apparently afraid to interrupt his revery.</p>

<p>“Ah! there you are, Georget. Have you seen your
lodgings? Do you like them? Is your mother better?<a name="page_299" id="page_299"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, my mother is overjoyed, and so am
I. Monsieur is too kind to us. Now that we are settled,
I have come to ask monsieur what work I shall do
to-day.”</p>

<p>“To-day, my friend, you must rest, walk about the
gardens and the house, and become acquainted with the
place; to-morrow we will talk about work. But first
of all, Georget, tell me your trouble; for you are in
trouble, I can see it in your eyes. Indeed, as you have
already confided in me about your love-affair, I ought
to know now how it happens that you have been able to
make up your mind to leave your young flower girl,
with whom you were so deeply in love. You could not
endure the thought of passing a single day without seeing
her, and now you are here, and you don’t want to hear
Paris mentioned! Poor boy! that girl who you said
was so virtuous and honest, must have listened to some
other man than you&mdash;isn’t it true that that is the cause
that has brought you here?”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! yes, monsieur, you have guessed the
truth; at all events, I prefer that you should know everything,
I prefer to tell you all my sorrow, for it is so hard
always to have to restrain one’s feelings! It stifles one!
Oh! allow me to cry, monsieur; I don’t dare to before
my mother, but it won’t offend you.”</p>

<p>“Weep, my boy; at your age, tears come readily, and
are a relief. You are not a man yet, you have not the
strength to endure a woman’s treachery; and even grown
men are very weak sometimes in such cases!<a name="page_300" id="page_300"></a>”</p>

<p>“Ah! who would ever have thought, monsieur, that
Violette, who seemed never to listen to any gallant&mdash;and
she has been to the rooms of one of them, the one
that I was most jealous of! Ah! I was right to be
jealous of him! a perfumed dandy, a lion, as they say!”</p>

<p>“But how do you know that she has been to his
rooms?”</p>

<p>“From another one, who also is in love with Violette,
and who saw her come out of this Monsieur Jéricourt’s,
who lives on his landing.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know that he tells the truth, especially
as the flower girl refused to listen to him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur! you may be sure that I didn’t believe
him either, that at first I called him a liar and an
impostor; indeed I would have thrashed him if he hadn’t
proposed to repeat it all to Violette herself in our presence;
he did it, monsieur; he spoke to her of her visit
to his neighbor, the swell Monsieur Jéricourt, and Violette
turned pale; and she couldn’t find a word to defend
herself, to contradict him!”</p>

<p>“In that case, my poor boy, you can no longer doubt
her infidelity; or at least, if she had never given you any
promise, her weakness for another. You have done well
to leave Paris, and come here with your mother; by
ceasing to see this girl, you will triumph over your love,
and you will soon find someone else to bestow your affections
upon. At your age, one loves so readily!”</p>

<p>“You think so, monsieur, but it seems to me that I
shall never be able to love any other woman than<a name="page_301" id="page_301"></a>
Violette. However, I will try, I will do my utmost, and if
I don’t see her any more&mdash;for you won’t send me to
Paris, monsieur, will you?”</p>

<p>“No, my boy, no, that is agreed. Indeed, Pongo
always goes when I need anything; and I myself go
quite often; but never fear, I won’t take you.”</p>

<p>“So much the better, monsieur, and I thank you. Now
I will walk about these lovely gardens with my mother,
monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Go, my friend, go.”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Brévanne left his house and walked
toward Monsieur Glumeau’s, saying to himself:</p>

<p>“I have not been very polite to my neighbors; they
invited me to their party, I saw their play, holding myself
aloof, and then I disappeared without even going
to pay my respects to them; as they cannot guess the
motive that led me to act so, I must repair my discourtesy
by going to call upon them.”</p>

<p>The count had almost reached Monsieur Glumeau’s
house, when a gentleman who came from it, and walked
toward him, stopped and uttered a cry of surprise at
finding himself face to face with Monsieur de Brévanne.
He in his turn examined the person who stood before him,
then held out his hand, saying:</p>

<p>“I am not mistaken, it is Monsieur de Merval!”</p>

<p>“The Comte de Brévanne!” cried Monsieur de
Merval, grasping the hand that was offered him. Then
he added: “I beg pardon, but you have dropped that
name, I believe?<a name="page_302" id="page_302"></a>”</p>

<p>“Yes, they call me Malberg now; but to you I shall
always be Brévanne. This is a meeting which I was far
from expecting, but of which I am very glad. Are you
coming from Monsieur Glumeau’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been to apologize for not accepting an
invitation which they sent me a fortnight ago, to a
party that they gave.”</p>

<p>“I know, I was at that party.”</p>

<p>“You were at that party?”</p>

<p>“That surprises you, does it not? I am a neighbor of
the Glumeaus; my place is only a few steps away; will
you do me the honor to come there and rest a moment?”</p>

<p>“I should be glad, but you are going somewhere?”</p>

<p>“To my neighbor’s; but that visit can be postponed,
whereas our meeting is one of those happy chances which
I wish to take advantage of to talk with you,&mdash;that is,
if you have the time to listen to me?”</p>

<p>“I am entirely at your service.”</p>

<p>“Come then.”</p>

<p>The two gentlemen soon reached the charming house
which had now two additional occupants. The count
ushered Monsieur de Merval into a pretty salon on the
ground floor, the windows of which looked on the Marne;
and taking a seat beside him, he said in a tone at once
melancholy and resigned:</p>

<p>“How many things have happened since we met! and
how many times you must have heard my name! The
thing that happened to me made a great deal of talk,
more talk than I desired, I assure you! Tell me, Monsieur<a name="page_303" id="page_303"></a>
de Merval, what did you hear about it, and whom did
you believe to be to blame in all that? For the world
is often mistaken in its judgment!”</p>

<p>Monsieur de Merval felt somewhat embarrassed to
answer; he faltered:</p>

<p>“Why, many contradictory things were said; however,
if you desire my opinion, why, you are not the one
whom I believed to be at fault!”</p>

<p>“You were right, but you should have guessed the
truth, for you knew Lucienne Courtenay before I became
her husband, fool that I was! I remember that I was
jealous of you even after my marriage&mdash;of you, who always
behaved with the most absolute delicacy; and I
was never jealous of the man who was destined to betray
my friendship in the most dastardly way!&mdash;Monsieur de
Merval, as chance has brought us together to-day, allow
me to tell you exactly what happened to me, and what
was the cause of my separation from my wife. I am
very glad to confide the truth to the breast of an honest
man. I should not have had the courage to tell you the
story a short time ago; but an encounter that I had within
a few days has strangely mitigated my suffering; I will
tell you that later&mdash;I come now at once to the main story.”</p>
